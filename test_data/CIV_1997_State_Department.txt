 . COTED'IVOIRE
 From independence-in 1960 until 1990, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny and his
 Democratic Party of Cote D'Ivoire (PDCI), then the only legal political party, gov-
 erned the Republic of Cote D'Ivoire. The PDCI maintained this. political dominance
 following multiparty presidential and legislative elections in 1990. Following
 Houphouet's death-in 1993, National Assembly President Henri Konan Bedie be-
 came President by constitutional succession, and served out the remainder of
 Houphouet's term. Due to concerns about irregularities in the electoral code and
 voter registration, the major opposition parties boycotted the 1995 presidential elec-
 tion andtried to interere with the voting process; however, President Bedie won
 96 percent of the vote. The major politicalparties then reached an accord with
 Bedie, which allowed for full party participatio n  the 1995 legislative elections.
 The judiciary, although nominally independent, is subject to executive branch influ-
 ence.
 Security forces include the national police (Surete)7and the Gendarmerie, a branch
 of the armed forces with responsibility for general law "enforcement. The Gendar-
 merie is a national police force charged with maintenance of public order and terri-
 torial security. Formed in August 1996, L'Etat Major de Ia Securite focuses on inter-
 nal security, specifically violent crime. A National Security.,Council, formed in July
 1996, coordinates security policy, both internal and external..The Special Anticrime
 Police Brigade (SAVAC) continued its operations. The armed forces traditionally
 have accepted the primacy of civilian authority. Seven members of the military ac-
 cused-of plotting a coup.in 1995 were dismissed from the military and released in
 December 1996. Security .forces including the SAVAC committed numerous human
 rights abuses.
 -The economy, largely market based but heavily dependent on the agricultural sec-
 tor; performed poorly in the 1980's and early 1990's when high population growth
 combined with weak commodity prices and an overvalued currency led to economic
 stagnation. Since the 1994 devaluation and the accompanying reforms, the economy
 has boomed, returning to real gross domestic product growth rates of 6 to 7 percent
 in 1995, 1996, and 1997. The Government devoted an increasing share of its budget
 to basic health services and education. It is unclear whether resumed growth and
 increased spending have created significant reductions in poverty or improvement
 in social indicators such as mortality or literacy rates. Gross national product per
 capita in 1996 was about $730. Principal exports are cocoa, coffee, wood, and, to an
 
 
 increasing extent, petroleum Most of the rural population remains dependent on
 smaliholder cash crop production.
 The Government's human rights record improved although serious human rights
 abuses remain in some areas. Members of the security forces committed
 extrajudicial killings, and the security forces beat and abused detainees and used
 force to disperse protesters. The Government also used arbitrary arrest and deten-
 tion and failed to bring perpetrators of these abuses to justice. Prison conditions are
 harsh and life threatemng, and prolonged detention is a problem. Leaders of the
 principal student organization were detained for various periods from December
 1996 to February 1997. The judiciary does not ensure due process and is subject to
 executive branch influence, particularly in political cases. The Government limits
 citizens' rights to change their government and restricts freedom of speech, the
 press, assembly, and association. Discrimination and violence against women and fe-
 male genital mutilation (FGM) remain problems. The Government announced a
 campaign to eliminate FGM in September 1996, but to date it has not taken any
 action.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings by government forces. However, as violent civil crime increased,
 the security forces frequently resorted to lethal force and committed numerous
 extrajudicial killings. Credible media reports indicate that the SAVAC continued its
 shoot-to-kill policy when pursuing criminal suspects. According to a press estimate,
 SAVAC and the regular police killed 91 persons. The Government did not prosecute
 SAVAC or police personnel for these killings. In the course of the operations, five
 police officers also were killed.
 In January police action led to a student leaping out of a building; he later died
 of his injuries (see Section 1.c.). A policeman who led a double life as a gangster
 was killed while in police custody on February 7, according to an opposition press
 re~o t.
 1Dozens of prisoners died in custody as a result of harsh prison conditions (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.).
 There was no progress in the August 1996 case in which police shot and killed
 a truck driver. The Minister of Security stated that the police implicated in the
 shooting had been questioned and that justice was "following its course." However,
 to date no one has been arrested or charged.
 The committee tasked by President Bedie to investigate killings that occurred
 during 1995's "active boycott" of the election presented its findings to Bedie in June.
 The findings have not been made public and Bedie has yet to act on them. These
 deaths included four protesters, eight demonstrators, and two security force mem-
 bers.
 There were no developments in the case of the six detainees who died in prison
 in 1996. They had been held since the "active boycott" of multiparty elections in Oc-
 tober 1995.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Despite legal protection for the rights of persons in custody, police sometimes beat
 detainees or prisoners as punishment, or to extract confessions, according to local
 human rights groups. There were no public reports of government officials being
 tried for these abuses.
 Jurists' union officials reported that police continue to beat suspects to obtain
 their confessions and that suspects are afraid to press charges against the police of-
 ficers involved. Press photographs regularly show criminal detainees with swollen
 or bruised faces and bodies.
 Police frequently use violence to restrain demonstrators. Riot police used tear gas
 and truncheons against protesting students on several occasions in the first half of
 the year. According to opposition press reports, a student was thrown by police from
 the second floor of his student apartment building on the night of January 19 after
 police had disrupted a meeting organized by the student union FESCI. He later died
 from his injuries. Government press reports stated that the student jumped while
 trying to escape from police.
 Prison conditions are harsh and life threatening. Problems include overcrowding,
 malnutrition, a high incidence of infectious disease, and lack of treatment facilities
 and medication. These conditions were responsible for a high prisoner death rate
 throughout the prison community. According to conflicting press reports, from 24 to
 
 
 44 prisoners died of cholera. Several journalists released from prison in late 1996
 reported that white-collar, prisoners are accorded more favorable treatment.
 According to the Ivorian Human Rights League (LIDHO), conditions at the main
 prison of A bin remain especially hazardous for women, with violent and non-
 violent criminals, as well as minors, housed together. There are no health facilities
 for women, and reportedly a number of women have given birth at the, prison with-
 out medical-attention. There are credible reports of female, prisoners being raped by
 t.prison guards.
 �Local human rights groups have difficulty gaining access to. the. prison. LIDHO
 .reports that it was often denied access to the prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Te Government arbitrarily arrests and
 detains citizens. Under the Code of-Penal Procedure, a public prosecutor may order
 the detention of a suspect for up to 48 hours without bringing char es. A magistrate
 may order detention up to 4 months but must also provide the Minister of Justice
 with a .written justification for continued detention on ,a monthly basis. However,
 the law is often violated. Police have held.persons formore than 48 hours without
 bringing charges. According to-a representative of the jurists' union, this practice
 is common, and oftemmagistrates-are not'able to verify that those not charged are
 released.
 Defendants do not have the right-to a judicial determination of the legality of
 their detention. A judge may release pretrial detainees on provisional liberty, if the
 judge believes that the suspect will not flee. The Attorney General on December 31,
 1996, referred in public to the long detention periods suffered by prisoners awaiting
 trial in the ountry's principal prison, the Maca, listing a total prisoner population
 of-4,600 of whom 1,741 were detainees who had yet to be tried. Of the detainees,
 470 had been detained for more than 2 years, 60 for at least 4 years, and 39 others
 between 5 and 12-years., Based on-these figures, pretrial detainees make up about
 35 percent of the prison .population. In March 51 new~judges assumed office, but
 at year's end the' number of pretrial detainees had not been significantly reduced.
 Informatiomprovided by one of the lawyers defending active boycott members ar-
 rested in 1995 suggests that -approximately 147 people are still awaiting trial. Of
 -this group, 100 people have been given provisional liberty until their trial dates, and
 47 remain in detention.. Eight .persons tried this year were.convicted; 2 were sen-
 tenced to 18-year.prison terms. An estimated 474 such persons were arrested origi-
 nally.
 Although prohibited by law, police restrict access to some prisoners. Despite the
 frequency of arbitrary arrest, there is no accurate total of suspects held.
 wenty-seven students, who had been detained without charge for varying periods
 since December 1996, were released in February (see also Sections i.e. and 2.b.).
 Seven, military officers (part of a group of 17 military personnel accused of plotting
 a coup and jailed without trial since October 1995) were dismissed from the military
 by a presidential decree and released from jail in December 1996.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-According to the Constitution, the judiciary is
 independent of the executive branch in ordinary criminal cases. In practice, how-
 ever, it follows the lead of the executive in national security or politically sensitive
 cases. There continue to be credible reports that those with ties to the opposition
 are treated more harshly by the judicial system than those with ties to the Govern-
 ment. Judges serve at the pleasure of the executive, and reports of political pressure
 on the judiciary are credible.
 The formal judicial system is headed by a Supreme Court and includes the Court
 of Appeals and lower courts.
 Military courts do not' try civilians. Although there are no appellate courts within
 the military court system, persons convicted by a military tribunal may petition the
 Supreme Court to set aside the tribunal's verdict and order a retrial.
 In rural areas, traditional institutions often administer justice at the village level,
 handling domestic disputes and minor land questions in accordance with customary
 law. Dispute resolution is by extended debate, with no known instance of resort to
 physical punishment. The formal court system is increasingly superseding these tra-
 ditional mechanisms. In August 1996, a Grand Mediator was appointed to settle dis-
 putes that cannot be resolved by traditional means. This office appears designed to
 bridge traditional and moder methods of dispute resolution. Thus far it has only
 been used to settle a succession dispute among the Abron people of Bondoukou.
 The law provides for the riglht to public trial, although key evidence is sometimes
 given secretly. Those convicted have the right of appeal, and the Appellate Court,
 in a departure from the norm, overturned on appeal the convictions of several active
 boycott members in 1996. Several others had their sentences reduced at the same
 time.
 
 
 86
 Defendants accused of felonies or capital crimes have the right to legal counsel,
 and the judicial system provides for court-appointed attorneys for indigent defend-
 ants. In practice many defendants cannot afford private counsel, and court-ap-
 ointed attorneys are not readily available. According to one lawyer, even if a de-
 endant has an attorney, he may not be notified of his trial date until the day before
 the trial, making it impossible for his lawyer to attend or provide a defense.
 There were no reports of political prisoners in civilian or military jails at year's
 end. However, three student leaders belonging to the banned student organization
 FESCI were convicted under a controversial law holding organizers of demonstra-
 tions criminally liable for any damages caused during demonstrations. They were
 jailed from January 7 until February 27 before being released by order of the Presi-
 dent.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Code of Penal Procedure specifies that a police official or investigative magistrate
 may conduct searches of homes without a judicial warrant if there is reason to be-
 lieve that there is evidence on the premises concerning a crime. The official must
 have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any evidence seized in the search and is
 required to have witnesses to the search, which may not take place between 9 p.m.
 and 4 a.m. In practice police have sometimes used a general search warrant without
 a name or addres. On occasion police have entered homes of non-Ivorian Africans
 (or apprehended them at large), taken them to local police stations, and extorted
 smal amounts of money for alleged minor offenses.
 Security forces reportedly monitored some private telephone conversations, but
 the extent of the practice is unknown. Letters and parcels are monitored at the post
 office for potential criminal activity, but there is no evidence that private written
 correspondence is monitored by authorities.
 The Government demolished a major Abidjan shanty town in September and relo-
 cated its residents to the city's outskirts. New, government-built housing costs half
 a month's salary for those earning the lowest minimum wage. The Government
 claimed the relocation will save lives regularly lost when heavy rains collapsed
 shanty houses; opposition media said that the relocations have caused suffering, loss
 of livelihood, and death.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of expression and independent newspapers frequently criticize government policies,
 the Government imposes restrictions. The two government-owned daily newspapers
 offer little criticism of government policy, while government-owned radio and tele-
 vision only infrequently report any discontent with government policy. Moreover,
 while independent newspapers (8 daily, several weekly), opposition leaders, and stu-
 dent groups voice their disapproval of governmental or presidential actions fre-
 quently and sometimes loudly, it is a crime, punishable by 3 months to 2 years in
 prison, to offend the President, the Prime Minister, foreign chiefs of state or govern-
 ment, or their diplomatic representatives, or to defame institutions of the State.
 Moreover, a 1991 press law created a commission to enforce laws against publishing
 material "undermining the reputation of the nation or defaming institutions of the
 State." Consequently, self-censorship is an ongoing concern of Ivorian journalists,
 but it has not led to the suppression of regular criticism of the President and gov-
 ernment policies.
 A journalist was detained in the city of Man on July 9 for reporting on a case
 of theft involving a subprefect. He was released on August 4.
 The Government owns both television channels and two major radio stations; only
 the primary government radio and television stations are broadcast nationwide.
 There are also four radio stations not controlled by the Government (British Broad-
 casting Corporation, Radio France International, Africa Number 1, and a private
 commercial radio station concentrating on entertainment, Radio Nostalgic). There is
 also a private television subscription service, Canal Plus Horizon. While the inde-
 pendent stations have complete control over their editorial content, the Government
 continues to exercise considerable influence over official media program content,
 news coverage, and other matters, using these media to promote government poli-
 cies. Much of the news programming is devoted to the activities of the President,
 the Government, the PDCI, and pro-Bedie groups.
 Manyprominent scholars are active in opposition politics and are not known to
 have suffered professionally, although some teachers and professors suggest that
 they have been transferred because of their political activities. According to press
 reports and student union statements, students continue to be used as informants
 at the University of Abidjan.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly. In practice, however, this freedom is restricted when the Gov-
 ernment perceives a danger to public order, as it did during the October 1995 elec-
 tions, when it used lethal force to control antigovernment demonstrations, which it
 had banned by decree.
 Groups that wish to hold demonstrations or rallies are required to submit a notice
 of their intent to do so to the Ministry of Security or Interior 48 hours before the
 proposed event. The Government sometimes denied the opposition permission to
 meet in public outdoor venues. Following opposition demonstrations in September
 1995, the Government announced that "all marches and sit-ins would be banned for
 a 3-month period in all streets and public places." The decree was selectively ap-
 plied; only opposition events were affected by the ban. Penalties for infraction
 ranged from no action to 12 months' imprisonment. Although the decree has not
 been canceled formally, no opposition events were banned in 1997.
 Police occasionally prohibit gatherings to prevent the expression of controversial
 views. A controversial "anti-vandalism" law passed by the National Assembly in
 1992 holds organizers of a march or demonstration criminally responsible if any of
 the participants engage in violence or damage to property. The LIDHO and all
 major opposition parties condemned the law as unduly vague and as one that im-
 posed collective punishment for the crimes of a few but have not attempted to chal-
 lenge the constitutionality of the law.
 The Constitution states that people are free to organize associations, and the im-
 plementing law states that organizations must register, but does not require any au-
 thorization. Consequently, opposition parties assert that the Constitution permits
 private associations to form, and since the Constitution does not mention registra-
 tion, requiring associations to register is unconstitutional. The Government rejects
 this interpretation and requires all organizations to register before commencing ac-
 tivities. There were no reports in the past 5 years of denial of registration.
 The law prohibits the formation of political parties along ethnic or religious lines.
 The 1991 ban on the previously registered student union FESCI was lifted during
 the September 30-October 9 national conference on the student crisis. During the
 years it was banned, FESCI contended the action was illegal and was active in dem-
 onstrations, ceremonies, and political conventions. In 1994 and again early this year
 (see Sections I.d. and .e.), the Government arrested or detained FESCI members
 without charge.
 According to credible media reports, there were violent confrontations between po-
 lice and students on January 19, January 21, February 5, February 27, May 16,
 Ma 20, June 20, and June 23. To disperse the students, police used tear gas, clubs,
 and, in some cases according to opposition press, live ammunition.
 Three student leaders who were convicted on January 7 under the "anti-vandal-
 ism" law and laws against disturbing the public order were pardoned by the Presi-
 dent on February 27. Twenty-seven other students, including the FESCI leader,
 were also released on that day. These students had not been formally charged but
 had been detained for varying periods of time since December 1996 (see Sections
 1.d. and i.e.).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and
 there are no known impediments to religious expression. There is no dominant reli-
 gion, and no faith is officially favored. The Government permits the open practice
 of religion, and there are no restrictions on religious ceremonies or teaching. Never-
 theless, some Muslims feel that their religious-or ethnic affiliation makes them tar-
 gets of discrimination by the Government with regard to high governmental posi-
 tions and national identity documentation.
 Native Muslims are frequently subject to petty harassment as part of general
 pressure against Muslims from neighboring countries and, despite being a plurality
 of the population, are a definite minority at all levels of government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice. While the Government does not generally restrict internal travel, uni-
 formed police regularly extort small amounts of money or goods for contrived or
 minor infractions by motorists or passengers on public conveyances. Citizens nor-
 eally may travel abroad and emigrate freely and have the right of voluntary repa-
 triation. There are no known cases of revocation of citizenship.
 Cote D'Ivoire is a siguatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to
 the Status of Refuges and its 1967 Protocol; it has sigued hut not ratified the Orga-
 nization of African Unity convention governing the specific aspects of refugee prob-
 lems in Africa. The right to first asylum is recognized by law and custom. Following
 a census in March, the estimated number of Liberian refugees dropped from 305,000
 to 210,000.
 
 
 88
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees in health, education, and food distribution programs for refugees. It initially
 agreed in principle to permit Liberian refugees to cast absentee ballots in that coun-
 try's- elections but later rejected the idea. However, several thousand refugees re-
 portedly returned to Liberia to vote in the July 19 elections, then reentered Cote
 D'Ivoire without incident.
 - There were no cases of forced repatriation. Despite the 1997-Liberian cease-fire
 -and democratic-elections, the Government has.indicated that-it -does not expect mas-
 sive near-term repatriation to occur and does not plan-to pressure refugees to depart
 before they are- ready to do so.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right.of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their govern-
 nent peacefully through democratic means; the Government limited this right in
 practice, The opposition complained that the Government. used the .1994 Electoral
 Code to   place, formidable -obstacles- in the-paths of political rivals. The
 Rassemblement des Republicains believed that Alassane Ouattara, a leading opposi-
 tion rival to Bedie, had been unfairly excluded from entering the presidential race
 due.to the Electoral -Code'sparentage, residency, and -citizenship requirements. The
 - opposition also complained of faulty voten registration procedures and of unfair re-
 strictions on demonstrations after-the Government issued-a 3-month ban on
 marches and sit-ins in September 1995 in an attempt to- ensure public order (see
 Section 2.b.)
 Under-a multiparty system� adopted. in-1990, elections are held every 5 years by
 secret ballot. AR citizens over 21 years of age can vote, and political parties are le-
 gally free to organize.
 A presidential election was held in 1995. The major opposition parties boycotted
 the election due to the Electoral Code's candidacy requirements and voter registra-
 tion irregularities. The opposition defied the national laws regarding law and order
 and called for "active boycott" of the polls during the presidential election. Members
 of the opposition blocked polling places from access by voters and prevented delivery
 of election materials to the polls. Only the ruling PDCI and a single small opposition
 party, the PIT, fielded presidential candidates. President Bedie won 96 percent of
 the votes cast.
 Afterward, the major political parties reached an accord that ensured full party
 participation in the 1995 legislative elections. These elections were, however, sus-
 pended in 3 of the 175 districts due to government concern over Bete-Baoule ethnic
 violence and voters displaced as a result of the active boycott. Election results from
 another three districts were declared invalid by the Constitutional Council. Elec-
 tions in these six districts and two. other open seats were held on December 29,
 1996, and proceeded in an orderly, transparent manner.
 While there are no legal impediments to women assuming political leadership
 roles, only 14 of the 169 deputies elected to the National Assembly are women.
 Women hold 3 of the 17 leadership positions in the Assembly, and there are 3
 women in the 29-member presidential Cabinet. Three members of the Supreme
 Court are women. There are no impediments to the exercise of political rights by
 any of the over 60 ethnic groups.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The LIDHO, formed in 1987 and recognized by the Government in July 1990, has
 actively investigated alleged violations of human rights and issued press releases
 and reports, some critical of the Government. Other groups such as the Inter-
 national Movement of Democratic Women (MIFED) have held seminars and pub-
 lished press releases critical of government abuses of human rights. In 1996 the
 Ministry of Family and Womens' Affairs and the Ministry of Communication took
 part in several NGO-sponsored campaigns to fight female genital mutilation and vi-
 olence against women, including domestics.
 Foreign government funding allowed Gerddes, a local NGO, to train the presi-
 dents of voting bureaus. The Observatoire National des Elections (ONE), an um-
 brella group of local NGO's, received official sanction and government cooperation
 -for observing the December 29, 1996 elections.
 The Government has cooperated with international inquiries into its human
 rights practices.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, or religion is prohib-
 ited by law, but in practice women occupy a subordinate role in society. In other
 respects, the Government enforces these provisions.
 Women.-Representatives of the Ivorian Association for the Defense of Women
 (AIDF) and other women's organizations state that spousal abuse (usually wife beat-
 ing)-while not widespread-does occur and often leads to divorce. Doctors state
 that they rarely see the victims of wife beating. A severe social stigma is attached
 to such violence, and neighbors often intervene in a domestic quarrel to protect a
 woman who is the object of physical abuse. The courts and police view such domes-
 tic violence as a family problem, unless serious bodily harm is inflicted or the victim
 lodges a complaint, in which case they may initiate criminal proceedings. The AIDF
 and the MIFED have protested the indifference of authorities to female victims of
 violence and called attention to domestic violence and FGM. The groups also re-
 ported that women who are the subject of rape or domestic violence are often ig-
 nored when they attempt to bring the violence to the attention of the police. The
 Government does not collect statistics on the rape or other physical abuse of women.
 AIDF is also active in opposing forced marriage and advancing the rights of female
 domestic workers. The Goverment has no clear cut policy regarding spouse abuse
 beyond the strictures against violence in the Civil Code.
 The President convened a day of consultations on the status of women on Feb-
 ruary 22. On March 10, he ordered the release of Fanta Keita, a 14-year old girl,
 who had killed her husband after being forced into marriage and subsequently
 raped repeatedly by him. The case had been a rallying c   or the AIDF in the
 struggle agast forced marriage and marriage of minors (which are formally
 banned under existing law but still occur).
 In rural areas, women and men divide the labor, with men clearing the land and
 attending to cash crops like cocoa and coffee, while women grow vegetables and
 other staples and perform most menial household tasks. Government policy encour-
 ages full participation by women in social and economic life, but there is consider-
 able informal resistance among employers in hiring women, whom they consider less
 dependable by virtue of potential pregnancy. Women are underrepresented in some
 professions and in the managerial sector as a whole. Some women also encounter
 inI~  in obtaining                                   in      Ic
 r             loans, as they cannot meet the lending criteria mandated by
 banks. Tihese criteria include such elements as title to a house and production of
 profitable cash crops, specifically coffee and cocoa. However, women in the formal
 sector are paid on an equal scale with men.
 Children.-Primary education is compulsory, but this requirement is not effec-
 tively enforced. Many children leave school after only a few years. There is a paren-
 tal preference for educating boys, which is noticeable throughout the country but
 more pronounced in rural areas, especially in the north. According to an Inter-
 national Monetary Fund report, giving statistics for 1987-1992, 81 percent of males
 and 58 percent of females attend primary schools. A 1996 United Nations Develop-
 ment Program report states that in 1993 combined primary, secondary, and tertiary
 school enrollment was 31.1 percent of females and 47.5 percent of males.
 The Ministries of Social Affairs and of Health and Social Protection seek to safe-
 guard the welfare of children, and the Government has also encouraged the forma-
 tion of NGO's such as the Abidjan Legal Center for the Defense of Children. In Sp-
 tember 1996, the Government announced a series of measures aimed at reducing
 the population of street children. These steps include holding parents legally an
 financially responsible for their abandoned children and the development of training
 centers where abandoned children can learn a trade. In January 200 children from
 Dabou were designated for training in such a center, created from 8 buildings ren-
 ovated by the Government, but by years end training had not begun. Some children
 are employed as domestics and are subject to sexual abuse, harassment, and other
 forms of mistreatment by their employers, according to AIDF and press reprts.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is a serious problem.
 There is no legislation that specifically prhibits1GM, and it is considered illegal
 only as a violation of general laws prohibiting crimes against persons. It is practiced
 particularly among the rural population in the north and west. The procedure is
 usuallyperformed on young girls or at puberty as part of a rite of passae; it is
 always done outside modern medical facilities. According to the World Healt Orga-
 nization, as many as 60 percent of women have undergone FGM.
 The AIDF continues to pursue a campaign, begun in May 1996, against FGM,
 dowry, forced marriage and marriage of minors, patterns of inheritance, and other
 practices that it considers harmful to women and girls. The NGO president enlisted
 
 
 President Bedie's support for the campaign and the Minister of Communications has
 continued to lend personal support by attending and speaking at seminars. In Sep-
 tember 1996, the Ministry of the Family and Women s Affairs announced a cam-
 paign against FGM, but new laws prohibiting FGM, which have been in preparation
 since that date, have yet to be presented for a vote. Meanwhile, traditional authori-
 ties continued to uphold the practice.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no laws mandating accessibility for the dis-
 abled. Laws exist prohibiting the abandonment of the mentally or physically dis-
 abled, as well as enjoining acts of violence directed at them. Traditional practices,
 beliefs, and superstitions vary, but infanticide in cases of serious birth disabilities
 is less commonplace than in the past. Disabled adults are not the specific targets
 of abuse, but it is difficult for them to compete with able-bodied workers in the tight
 job market. The Government supports special schools, associations, and artisans' co-
 operatives for the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Among both Ivorians and non-Ivorians, it is
 a widely-held perception that police routinely abuse and harass non-Ivorian Africans
 residing in the country (who represent one-third of the total population). This activ-
 ity reflects the Ivorian conclusion that foreigners are responsible for high local crime

 Members of the Bete" ethnic group allege discrimination by the more powerful
 "Baoule tribal group. The Baoules are the single largest tribal, group in the country
 and have been politically dominant. According to the Bete, in 1970 members of the
 army killed 4,000 Bete in-the Gagnoa region. Tensions between the groups escalated
 before the 1995 presidential elections, again in the Gagnoa region, and four people
 Iwere killed during:rioing. Some Baoule settlers, and native Guere people of the
 Duekoue region in the western    . art of  country fought in August, leading to five
 deaths and significant property damage.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides workers with the right to form
 unons. The government-sponsored labor confederation, the General Union of Work-
 ers of Cote 1D'Ivoire (UGTI), dominated most union activity. The UGTCrs hold on
 the labor movement loosened in 1991 when several formerly UGTCI-affiliated
 eunions broke away and became Andependent. In 1992 11 formerly independent
 unions joined together to form the Federation of Autonomous Trade Unions of Cote
 d'Ivoire Unions are free to join theseand other groups. Registration of a new union
 requires,3 months under the law.
 The right to strike is providd by the Constitution and by statute. The Labor Code
 requires a protracted series of negotiations and a 6-day notification period before a
 �strike may take place, effectively making legal strikes difficult to organize. The
 UGTCI seldom calls strikes. NonUGTC unions frequently called strikes. Police
 used tear gas on March 25 to disrupt a strike by employees of the state-rn naval
 construction yard; three injuries resulted, according to press reports.
  Unions are free to join international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-sThe Labor Code grants all
 citizens the right to join unions except members of the police and military, and to
 bargain collectively. Collective bargaining agreements are in effect in many major
 Sbusiness enterprises and sectors of the civil service. In most cases in which wages
 are not established in direct, negotintions between unions and employers, salaries
 are set by job categories by the Ministry of Employment and Civil Service. Labor
 -inspectors have the-responsibility to enforce a law that prohibits antiunion discrimi-
 nation.
 -There -are no, export processing zones.
 *  c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There were no reports of forced
 ,or bonded labor, which is prohibited by law. This legal prohibition applies to chil-
 dren and it is effectively enforced. The International Labar Organization's Commit-
 tee of-Experts in its 1993 annual- report questioned a decree that places certain cat-
 egories of prisoners at the disposal of private enterprises for work assignments with-
 out their apparent consent. There has been no change in this decree.
 d. Status of Child Labor-Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced -and banded child labor and enforces this prohibition effec-
 tively (see Section 6.c.).
 instances, the legal minimum working age is 16 years, and the Ministry
 "of Employment and Civil Service enforces this provision effectively in the civil serv-
 ice an in large multinational companies. Labor law limits the hours of young work-
 
 
 ers, defined as those under the age of 18. However, children often work on family
 farms, and some children routinely act as vendors, shoe shiners, errand boys, car
 watchers, and washers of car windows in the informal sector in cities. There are re-
 liable reports of some use of child labor in informal sector mining and also of chil-
 dren working in "sweatshop" conditions in small workshops. Primary education is
 mandatory and free but far from universally enforced, particularly in rural areas.
 Many children leave the formal school system when they are between the ages of
 12 and 14, having failed secondary school entrance exams.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively determines
 monthly minimum wage rates, which were last adjusted in May 1996. A slightly
 higher minimum wage rate applies for construction workers. The Government en-
 forces the minimum wage rates only for salaried workers employed by the Govern-
 ment or registered with the social security office. Minimum wages vary according
 to occupation, with the lowest set at approximately $58 (cfa 35,000) per month,
 which is insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 The majority of the labor force works in agriculture or in the informal sector where
 the minimum wage does not apply.
 Through the Ministry of Employment and the Civil Service, the Government en-
 forces a comprehensive Labor Code governing the terms and conditions of service
 for wage earners and salaried workers and providing for occupational safety and
 health standards. Those employed in the formal sector are reasonably protected
 against unjust compensation, excessive hours, and arbitrary discharge from employ-
 ment. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. The law requires overtime payment
 on a graduated scale for additional hours. The Labor Code provides for at least one
 24-hour rest period per week.
 Government labor inspectors can order employers to improve substandard condi-
 tions, and a labor court can levy fines if the employer fails to comply. In the large
 informal sector of the economy, however, involving both urban and rural workers,
 the Government's occupational health and safety regulations are enforced erratically
 at best. Workers in the formal sector have the right, under the Labor Code, to re-
 move themselves from dangerous work without jeopardy to continued employment
 by utilizing the Ministry of Labor inspection system to document dangerous working
 conditions. However, workers in the informal sector cannot ordinarily remove them-
 selves from such labor without losing their employment.
