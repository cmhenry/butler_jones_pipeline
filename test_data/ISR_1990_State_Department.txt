 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty
 political system and free elections. There is no.
 constitutjon,-'but a series of basic laws defines the
 responsibilities of government institutions. The legislature
 (the Knesset) can limit the government and force its
 dissolution.. Israel hasan independent judiciary. Public
 debate on issues of concern to Israelis is open and lively. A
 vigorous free press scrutinizes all aspects of Israeli life
 and politics.
 Since Israel's founding in 1948, it has been in a formal state
 of war with most of its Arab neighbors, except Egypt, with
 which it concluded a peace treaty in 1979. As a result of the
 1967 war, Israel has occupied the territories of the West
 Bank, the Gaza Strip, the eastern sector of Jerusalem, and the
 Golan Heights.
 Throughout-,its history as a state, Israel-has experienced
 numerous terrorist incidents, within and outside its borders.
 In this atmosphere of hostility and threat, Israel has relied
 heavily on its military and related services for-security and
 has retained many of the security-related emergency
 regulations from the preindependence British mandate'period.
 Internal security is the responsibility of the general
 security service (Shin Bet), which is under the authority of.
 the Prime Minister's office. The police are under the
 authority of a separate minister. The Israeli Defense Forces
 (IDF)--which include a significant portion of the Israeli
 adult population in either active duty or reserve status--
 also play a role in maintaining internal security. The IDF is
 under the authority of a civilian Minister of Defense. The
 Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee reviews the
 activities of the IDF and the Shin Bet.
 Israel has a predominantly market economy with substantial
 government regulation; subsidies for basic commodities have
 been largely phased out. Economic policy has a strong social
 welfare orientation. Israel enjoys a relatively high standard
 of living.
 Israeli citizens exercise a wide range of civil and political
 rights. Israel's Arab citizens have, nonetheless, not shared
 fully in the rights granted to, and the duties levied on',
 Jewish citizens.
 In 1990, despite noteworthy improvements, Israel's most
 significant human rights problem remained its practices in
 confronting the Palestinian uprising in the occupied
 territories. (For a detailed discussion, see the separate
 report on the occupied territories.)
 * Because the legal status and the political and human rights
 conditions of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem differ
 sharply from those in Israel, the situation there is dealt
 with in a separate report following the report for Israel.

 ISRAEL
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political killings in Israel are neither practiced nor
 officially sanctioned. In the context of the extreme
 political tension between rsrael and the Palestinians,
 intercommunal killings are often assumed to have political
 motivation. For example, in 1990, in a single incident, seven
 Palestinians were killed by an apparently deranged Israeli
 civilian. Although there was no specific evidence indicating
 political motivation for these killings, the fact that the
 killer chose Palestinians cannot be separated from the
 atmosphere of Israeli-Palestinian political tensions.
 Immediately after the assassination of Rabbi Meir Kehane in
 New York, a Gaza resident was shot to death inside Israel,
 apparently by an Israeli, in what appeared to be an anti-Arab
 reprisal for the assassination.
 Following the October 8 incident on the Temple Mount/Haram
 al-Sharif, Palestinians stabbed to death seven Israelis and
 wounded a number of others in separate incidents. Although
 some Palestinian leaflets distributed at the time in support
 of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories
 extolled "the intifada of the knives," most of these assaults
 appear to have been independent and random attacks. Also in
 1990, a bomb on a Tel Aviv beach killed one person. This kind
 of attack, aimed at Israelis, appeared designed to exploit
 Israeli-Pa-lestinia- political tensions.
 b. Disappearance
 The Israeli Government does not practice or condone
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Israeli laws and administrative regulations prohibit such
 practices. (See the occupied territories report for a
 discussion of allegations of torture and mistreatment of
 Palestinians from the occupied territories who are
 incarcerated in detention facilities located in- rsrael.)
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Israeli law and practice guarantee against arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other procedurl and
 substantive safeguards-are available. Defendants are
 considered innocent until proven guilty,
 Administrative detention, with no formal charge or trial, is
 permitted under emergency regulations. The Minister of
 Defense may issue a detention order for a maximum of 6
 months. Within 48 hours of issuance of such an order, a
 district judge must review the case and may confirm, amend, or
 overturn the detention order. Failing review within the
 designated time period, the detainee must be released. The
 detainee may be represented by counsel and may appeal to the
 Supreme Court. The Government may withhold evidence from the
 detainee and counsel on security grounds. Two Israeli Arabs
 were administratively detained in 1990, one under a 6-month
 
 
 1470
 ISRAEL
 order issued in 1990 and the other under a 6-month order that
 carried-over from 1989 into 1990, followed by a second such
 order issued 'in'1990. Both were released near the end of
 1990, and, at the end of the year, no Israeli citizens were
 held in administrative detention. In 1990 Israel continued to
 hold most Palestinian administrative detainees from the
 occupied territories in detention centers inside Israel. (For
 a full discussionof administrative detention of Palestinians,
 see the separate report on the occupied territories.)
 Israel-doe� not exile its citizens.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a hearing by an impartial tribunal with
 representation by counsel is provided for by law and enshrined
 in practice.- The judiciary is independent and effectively
 insulated from political interference. All nonsecurity trials
 are open. Security cases may be tried before a military court
 or a civil court and may be partly or wholly closed to the
 public. The burden of justifying nonpublic proceedings falls
 on the prosecution. Defense counsel is present, even during
 closed proceedings, but may be denied-access to some evidence
 on security grounds. In security cases in which access to
 some-evidence is denied, that evidence is not usable during a
 court trial.
 "f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Privacy of-the individual and the home is protected by law
 within Israel. Emergency regulations permit mail to be
 stopped, opened, and even destroyed on security grounds. A
 1979 law allows tapping of telephones for security reasons,
 with confirmation by the Prime Minister or Defense Minister.
 Interference with mail and the tapping of telephones are
 practiced infrequently.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 (See the separate report on the occupied territories.)
 Section-2 Respect for Civil Libefties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Individuals, organizations, the press, and the electronic
 media freely debate a wide range of public issues and
 criticize government officials and policies with few
 restrictions. However, publications and press articles for
 domestic or foreign publication dealing with security-related
 matters must be submitted to the military censor. Arabic-
 language'publications and press are censored more strictly
 than Hebrew-language equivalents. In 1990 an Arab poet was
 put on trial for a book of poems alleged to incite violence.
 The trial was still in progress at the end of 1990. An
 Arabic-language weekly was closed for 3 months for alleged
 anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist incitement. Recent High Court
 of Justice rulings have narrowed the range of material that
 may be censored on security grounds.
 Statements or writings expressing or encoupaging support for
 outlawed organizations are illegal. The infrequent
 prosecutions pursued on these grounds have most often been
 
 
 1471
 
 ISRAEL
 directed against Israeli Arabs. For example, in 1990 three
 young Arab men were sentenced to 4 to 6 months for flying
 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)flags and painting
 hostile slogans. Provisions against maintaining contact with,
 or accepting support from, outlawed organizations apply to the
 media as well as to individuals, although no media
 organization was prosecuted on these grounds in 1990.
 All newspapers are privately owned and managed. All of the
 electronic media are government-controlled, and many are run
 by the quasi-independent Israel Broadcast Authority, whose
 chief is appointed by the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Israelis representing almost any point of view are free to
 assemble and associate. The law and court rulings protect
 these rights. However, emergency regulations prohibit
 membership in, or contact with, outlawed organizations, their
 subdivisions, or their individual members. In 1990 an Israeli
 peace activist, who was jailed in 1989 for such an offense,
 was charged again for repeating the same offense. Court
 proceedings had not yet begun as of the end of 1990.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In Israel there are strong guarantees of freedom for all
 faiths. Approximately 82 percent of Israeli citizens are
 Jewish. Muslims, Christians, Druze, and members of other
 minority religions make up the remaining 18 percent. Travel
 to visit religious sites or perform religious obligations in
 and outside Israel is widely permitted. In 1990 Israel
 approved the pilgrimage to Mecca of about 6,400 Israeli
 Muslims, rejecting a small percentage of applications and
 restricting the age of male applicants to 40 or over on
 security grounds. However, restrictions imposed by Jordan and
 Saudi Arabia limited the numbers to approximately 3,500.
 Each recognized religious community in Israel has legal
 authority over its members in matters of marriage, legitimacy,
 inheritance, and conversion. Orthodox religious authorities
 have exclusive control over these matters in all sectors of
 the Jewish community, whether or not they are Orthodox.
 Missionaries are allowed to work in Israel. A 1977
 antiproselytizing law, prohibiting the offering and receipt of
 material benefits as an inducement to conversion, was not
 enforced in 199Q.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Israeli citizens may move freely within Israel as well as the
 occupied territories, except in military or security zones or
 if they are restricted to their neighborhood or village by
 administrative order under emergency regulations. In 1990 one
 Israeli Arab was restricted in this fashion. Israeli citizens
 are free to travel abroad and to emigrate, provided they have
 no outstanding military obligations or are not restricted by
 administrative order. In 1990 the Israeli Government lifted a
 longstanding ban on the travel of. an Israeli Arab political
 activist but imposed temporary restrictions on four other
 Israeli Arab activists, including one prominent figure who was
 twice prevented from traveling.
 
 
 1472
 ISRAEL
 Israel welcomes Jewish immigrants, including Jewish refugees,
 to whom it gives automatic citizenship, residence rights, and
 a package-of-financial axd other benefits to facilitate their
 integration  nto Isgaeli society. Israel accepts the return
 of Israeli citizens who have emigrated. Israel has allowed
 the return of some Palestinians on the principle of family
 reunificationibut has rejected the great majority of requests
 by Palestinians for return.
 Section 3' Respect-for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 -.   to Change-Their-Government
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy, with a multitude of
 parties representing a wide-range of political views.
 Relatively small parties, including those whose primary
 support is among Israeli Arabs, regularly win seats in the
 Knesset . -All adult Israeli citizens have the right to
 participate -in the pp-1itical process and to vote by secret
 ballot. Participation of eligible voters, including Israeli
 Arabs, in recent national and local elections has been
 relatively, high.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Israel is responsive to international and nongovernmental
 interest in its human- rights situation. . It hosts and works
 with a delegation of the-International Committee of the Red
 Cross and permits, regular visits by a wide range of private
 and dternational organizations concerned about. human rights
 such as Amnesty International (AI), Middle East Watch, the
 Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the International Labor
 Organization (ILO), and others. The Ministry of Justice has a
 human rights office which responds to human rights inquiries.
 The Government has designated specific points of contact
 within the Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs to give
 timely responses to human rights inquiries from foreign
 governments, international bodies, and human rights
 organizations. Israel refused, however, to accept a mission
 appointed by the Secretary General of the United Nations in
 accordance with United Nations Security Council resolution 672
 to investigate the incident at the Temple Mount/Haram
 al-Sharif on October 8. The Israeli Government insisted that
 this event took place in Jerusalem, over which it claims
 sovereignty, and was an internal matter.
 Private Israeli organizations are active in publicizing and
 litigating human rights issues and cases. The Government and
 the courts treat seriously responsible challenges to its human
 rights practices.
 Section.5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women's rights in Israel are protected by the equal
 opportunity law, which forbids sex discrimination. For
 example, it requires employers to pay male and female workers
 equal wages for equal work. Other laws and regulations give
 protection to women employees regarding pregnancy, childbirth,
 and child care. The Government includes a senior adviser on
 the status of women, and the Civil Service Commission and
 several government ministries have officers responsible for
 women's rights. Nongovernmental women's organizations work
 
 
 1473
 
 ISRAEL
 actively in promoting women's rights and welfare. Women are
 drafted into the army but do not fill combat-related positions.
 Domination of personal status law by religious courts (whether
 Jewish or Muslim) means that women may be subj .et to
 restrictive interpretations of their marriage and divorce
 rights. For example, it may be more difficult for a woman
 than for a man to initiate successful divorce proceedings.
 The courts in Israel deal firmly with persons convicted of
 violence, including violence against women. Human-rights
 groups, especially women's groups, are increasingly active in
 dealing with the issue of domestic violence against women, and
 the Government provides some funding for intervention
 activities.
 Israeli Arabs, who comprise approximately 18 percent of
 Israel's population, have made substantial educational and
 material progress.since the founding of Israel. A few have
 risen to responsible positions in the civil service, generally
 in the Arab departments of government ministries. There are
 six Arab members of the Knesset. The Arabic-speaking
 community has access to the local and foreign Arabic press,
 publications, and media. However, Israeli Arabs have not
 attained the same quality of education, housing, or other
 services as Israeli Jews.
 The Israeli Druze and Circassian communities, at their
 initiative, are subject to Israel's military draft, and some
 Bedouin Arabs serve voluntarily in special units. However,
 most Israeli Arabs are not subject to the draft, and few
 volunteer. Consequently, they have less access than do other
 Israelis to such social and economic benefits as subsidies for
 housing and children, and government or security-related
 industrial employment for which military service is either a
 prerequisite or an advantage.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Israeli workers have freely established organizations of their
 own choosing. Most unions belong to the powerful General
 Federation of Labor in Israel (Histadrut) or to a much smaller
 rival federation. About.60 percent of adult Israelis,
 including Israeli Arabs, are members of Histadrut trade
 ,unions, and still more are covered by Histadrut social and
 insurance programs and collective bargaining agreements.
 Histadrut members democratically elect national and local
 officers and those of its affiliated trade unions and women's
 organizations from-political party lists. Plant or enterprise
 committee members are elected individually.
 The right to strike is exercised regularly. A 15-day notice
 prior to a strike or lockout is legally mandated, unless
 otherwise specified in the collective bargaining agreement.
 Histadrut tries to maintain discipline with a central strike
 fund, but unauthorized strikes do occur. If essential public
 services are affected, the Government may appeal to labor
 courts, which include employer and employee representatives,
 for back-to-work orders while negotiations continue. Such
 orders are not always granted.
 
 
 1474
 
 ISRAEL
 Strike activity in 1990 was relatively low. Among the more
 important strikes were two Histadrut-sponsored strikes, one a
 24-hour strike to protest the expiration of the collective
 bargaining agreement, the second a 2-day strike to protest a
 Ministry of Finance proposal to alter the minimum wage law.
 Labor laws applicable in Israel also apply to Palestinians in
 East Jerusalem (see the occupied territories report for
 further discussion of worker rights in East Jerusalem and the
 West Bank and Gaza).
 Unions are free to form federations and confederations and to
 affiliate internationally. Histadrut is affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
 Nonresident workers, most of whom are the approximately
 105,000 nonresident Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza
 working in Israel, may not be members of Histadrut and may not
 organize their own trade unions within Israel. Palestinian
 trade unions in the occupied territories are not permitted to
 operate in Israel. However, nonresident workers in the
 organized sector, including Palestinians from the occupied
 territories, are entitled to Histadrut contract and grievance
 protection, and may join, vote for, and be elected to shop
 level workers' committees if their numbers in individual
 establishments pass a minimum threshold. During the uprising
 in the occupied territories, Palestinian participation in
 these committees has dwindled to near zero.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Israelis fully exercise their legal right to organize and
 bargain collectively. The majority union (generally
 Histadrut) is the exclusive bargaining agent.
 Nonresident workers may not organize on their own or bargain
 collectively, but those (primarily Palestinians) that are
 hired through official channels and thus work in the organized
 sector are entitled to representation by the bargaining agent
 and the protection of collective bargaining agreements. Most
 such workers are not in the organized sector.
 While there is no law prohibiting antiunion discrimination,
 the politically powerful Histadrut organization has never felt
 a need to promote such a law. Local sources indicate that the
 basic law against discrimination could be used in the courts
 to contest discrimination based on union membership.
 Collective Histadrut pressure, including but not limited to
 strikes, would be another means of resolving complaints. No
 antiunion discrimination has been observed. There are no
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and neither
 Israeli citizens nor nonresident Palestinians working in
 Israel are subject to such practices.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 By law, children under age 15 may not be employed.
 Schoolchildren aged 15 may not be employed without special
 permission, except as apprentices or during school vacations.
 Employment of those aged 16 to 18 is restricted to ensure time
 for rest and education. Israeli labor exchanges do not
 process work applications for West Bank.or Gaza Palestinians
 
 
 1475
 ISRAEL
 under age 17. A Labor Inspection Service enforces these
 provisions, though enforcement is difficult in smaller,
 unorganized enterprises.
 e.   Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Wage income in Israel is generally sufficient to provide
 workers and their families a decent standard of living.
 Legislation in 1986 established a minimum wage at 45 percent
 of the average salary, calculated periodically. At the most
 recent adjustment, that figure was $508 a month. Most wages
 and salaries are established in collective bargaining
 agreements. The Labor Ministry frequently uses the 1957
 Collective Agreements Law to extend private sector wage
 settlements to the public sector and sectoral wage settlements
 to other, uncovered enterprises. Along with union
 representation, the Labor Inspection Service effectively
 enforces labor, health, and safety standards in the workplace.
 By law, maximum hours of work at regular pay are 47 hours per
 week, 8 per day, and 7 the day before the weekly rest, which
 must be at least 36 consecutive hours and should include the
 Sabbath. Exceptions may be approved by the, Labor Ministry but
 may not exceed 10 hours per day, or an average of 47 hours per
 week. By national collective agreements, the private sector
 established a maximum 45-hour workweek in August 1988 while
 the public sector moved to a 5-day, 42.5-hour workweek in
 April 1989. About half the private sector work force was
 working a 5-day week by the end of 1990.
 Only about 33,000 of the estimated 105,000 nonresident West
 Bank and Gaza Palestinians working in Israel are hired legally
 through Israeli employment service labor exchanges in the West
 Bank and Gaza. In many respects, these workers are covered by
 the laws and collective bargaining agreements that cover
 Israeli workers, including minimum wage, sick leave, severance
 pay, paid vacations, and pensions administered by the Ministry
 of Labor. They are paid through the employment service, which
 receives their wages and benefits from employers and pays the
 recipient after deducting taxes, a 1-percent union fee, and
 contributions to the National Insurance Institute (NII). The
 same percentage (5.35 percent) for NII contributions is-
 deducted from the pay of legally hired nonresident
 Palestinians and from Israeli workers. These Palestinian
 workers receive some of the benefits of these contributions
 that Israeli workers receive: full coverage for workmen's
 compensation, employer bankruptcy insurance, and maternity
 benefits (only for births in Israeli hospitals). However,
 they do not receive a number of benefits that require
 residence in Israel: NII old-age, survivors, and disability
 pensions; unemployment compensation; insurance for long-term
 care or injury in nonoccupational accidents; NII children's
 allowances; or NII-administered welfare programs.
 Because of these benefit restrictions, only 1.2 percent of
 nonresident Palestinian workers' pay goes to-the NII. The
 remaining 4.15 percent is nonetheless deducted from their pay
 in order to equalize the labor costs of Palestinians and
 Israelis and goes to a special fund earmarked for social and
 development expenditure in the West Bank and Gaza. This
 deduction has been criticized by Palestinians, who estimate
 that hundreds of millions of dollars in deductions have gone
 to' the Israeli Government, with no public accounting for the
 Government's use of the funds. The Government insists that
 
 
 1476
 
 ISRAEL
 all money thus collected is used exclusively in the West Bank
 and Gaza, but. it has not made budget figures public.
 Israeli settlers living in the occupied territories but
 working inside Israel have the same benefits as all other
 Israeli workers.
 Histadrut has defended Palestinian workers against dismissal
 for absences caused by official curfews or Palestinian-called
 general strikes, but with limited success. Histadrut has used
 plant-site visits, public announcements, and worker rights
 seminars to inform legally hired Palestinians of their
 rights. In 1990 Histadrut and a private organization
 independently established legal aid centers designed to
 protect Palestinian workers' rights.
 The majority of nonresident Palestinians find work in Israel
 outside the official hiring system. They work primarily in
 day labor, seasonal agriculture, and small enterprises where
 wages are generally low, where protections (including minimum
 wage)'and social benefits available in the organized sector
 are often -absent, and where taxes and other deductions are not
 taken from their pay. Nonresident Gazan males working in
 Israel are required to have permits to enter Israel. All
 nonresident Palestinians must have a permit in order to remain
 overnight in Israel; these are rarely granted, forcing those
 who do remain overnight to do so illegally, often in
 substandard housing. Official enforcement of these
 requirements during most of 1990 was flexible and did not
 interfere significantly with Palestinians' access to work in
 Israel.
 In 1989 the Director General of the International Labor
 Organization and the ICFTU called for steps to equalize the
 benefits and protections available to Israeli and nonresident
 Palestinian workers. They also called for steps to revamp the
 social security system to give nonresident Palestinians full
 social benefits or to reimburse them for those deductions that
 did not go to direct social benefits. These recommendations
 were not met in 1990.
 
 
 1477
 
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Whereas almost all other reports in this volume deal with the
 relationship between governments and their own citizens, this
 report concerns the practices of the authorities of one
 country in the exercise of governmental functions in
 territories outside that country and under military
 occupation. The lands known as the "occupied territories"
 (the West Bank, Gaza strip, Golan Heights, and East ;erusalem)
 were occupied by Israel in the 1967 war and have been under
 military occupation since then.
 Israel is not recognized internationally to have sovereignty
 over any of the occupied lands, but has asserted sovereignty
 over and annexed East Jerusalem. The West Bank and Gaza are
 governed under Jordanian, Egyptian, and British law, modified
 by military orders. Israeli law and administration have been
 extended to the Golan Heights.
 The United States considers Israel's occupation to be governed
 by the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the 1949 Fourth Geneva
 Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in
 Time of War. Israel does not consider the Convention
 applicable but states that it observes its humanitarian
 provisions.
 Israel governs the West Bank and Gaza through a Civil
 Administration (CIVAD), which reports to the Minister of
 Defense. There are Arab municipalities with both elected and
 Israeli-appointed mayors, but municipal and local elections
 have not been held since 1976. Palestinian political activity
 is severely restricted. The CIVAD does not afford
 Palestinians the opportunity to participate meaningfully in
 significant political or economic decisions in the occupied
 territories. Israeli settlers in the territories (about 5
 percent of the population) are subject to Israeli law, which
 in most cases treats them more favorably than Palestinians are
 treated under occupation laws and regulations. Economic
 policies often discriminate against Palestinians in favor of
 Israeli interests and Israeli settlers in the territories.
 The security forces in the occupied territories consist of the
 army (Israel Defense Forces - IDF, the Shin Bet (General
 Security Service), the police, and the paramilitary Border
 Police. Security crimes are tried in military courts staffed
 by IDF officers.
 Since 1967, Palestinians have protested, often violently,
 against Israel's occupation. The massive civilian unrest
 known as the intifada erupted in late 1987, and the ensuing
 Palestinian violence and Israeli crackdown continued in 1990.
 Violence directed at Israeli security personnel and civilians
 in the territories has been both organized and spontaneous.
 Israeli authorities have responded with a variety of measures,
 some of which the United States has opposed.
 Security authorities sought to reduce the levels of violence
 during the summer of 1990 by measures designed to avoid
 confrontation, and Palestinian and Israeli casualties declined
 during July, August, and September. During the last quarter
 of 1990, however, a series of incidents, including the
 immolation of an IDF reservist in j3aza and the killing of 17
 Palestinians on the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem,
 and'widespread Palestinian support for Iraq's Saddam Hussein
 
 
 1478
 
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 led, to an emotional heightening of tensions on both sides and
 an increase in incidents and casualties. These included a
 rash of politically motivated but generally spontaneous random
 stabbings of Israelis in Israel by Palestinians from the
 territories. Israeli authorities responded to this violence
 with intensified security measures such as broadly barring the
 entry of Palestinians from the territories into Israel and
 Jerusalem, and deciding to resume deportations of Palestinians
 alleged to be extremist leaders.
 The year 1990 witnessed a significant increase in violence by
 Palestinians against Palestinians, including 165 murders that
 appear to have been politically motivated. This number is
 greater than the 130 Palestinians killed in 1990 by Israeli
 security forces and civilians.
 The continuing unrest and violence in the occupied territories
 underlines the need for a political solution, which has been
 strongly advocated by the United States.
 Israeli occupation policies and anti-intifada practices,
 combined with escalating intifada violence, continue to be of
 serious concern to the United States. Although conditions
 generally improved during the first three quarters of the
 year, they deteriorated in the fourth quarter. The United
 States remains concerned about the continuing violence, death,
 and injuries on both sides, including the killing of
 Palestinians by fellow-Palestinians, the excessive use of
 force by security forces! and certain restrictive CIVAD and
 IDF measures, including restraints on nonviolent political
 activity and expression, the continued closure of four
 universities, travel bans and restrictions, deportations,
 administrative detention, restrictions on family
 reunification, and discriminatory policies or practices
 affecting land, resource use, and trade and commerce.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political killing is not practiced or condoned by the
 Government of Israel. However, several human rights groups
 alleged that in 1990 Israeli security forces intentionally
 killed five wanted Palestinian activists in circumstances in
 which the use of force was unnecessary, inappropriate, or
 unauthorized. Israeli officials state that their
 investigations determined that two of the killings were
 accidental, two occurred when security forces fired at fleeing
 suspects, and one was in self-defense when the victim pulled
 out a grenade (later discovered to be a tear-gas grenade).
 Israeli settlers killed 10 Palestinians in 1990 in what
 appeared to be politically related circumstances. A leader of
 the settler movement, who killed a Hebron storeowner and
 wounded a customer in 1988, was sentenced in 1990 to 1 year in
 prison (with 7 months of the sentence suspended) for negligent
 homicide and aggravated injury. He was released in August
 under Israel's Administrative Release law after serving 3 1/2
 months.
 
 
 1479
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Endorsements of "all forms of struggle" against Israel,
 including "massive martyrdom" and "suicide operations,"
 appeared in intifada-related literature during the last part
 of 1990. These were accompanied by an increase in the
 violence of attacks by Palestinians against Israeli security
 personnel and civilians in both the territories and Israel
 proper. Palestinians killed 4 Israeli security officials and
 6 Israeli civilians in the occupied territories in 1990.
 During 1990, 165 Palestinians were killed by other
 Palestinians (compared to 128 in 1989). Many others were
 wounded, and there were frequent threats and acts of
 intimidation by Palestinians against fellow-Palestinians.
 These included Palestinians killed because of alleged
 "collaboration" with Israel, interfactional political disputes
 and private feuds, and some for alleged crimes against public
 morality. Some of the victims were village officials and Arab
 policemen. Israeli authorities allege that many of these
 attacks and acts of intimidation were carried out under the
 direction of the covert leadership of the uprising. Others
 were by individuals or gangs operating autonomously, though
 these acts were often accompanied by claims of pro-Palestinian
 political motivations. Charges of so-called collaboration
 have been made (and murders subsequently committed) carelessly
 and for trivial reasons, deliberately, and at times to settle
 personal scores. On several occasions during 199G,
 Palestinian leaders called for a halt to unauthorized
 executions and other such actions.
 Israeli authorities prosecute Palestinians accused of murder
 of other Palestinians, and sentences are severe. In one
 instance, members of the "Black Panthers" and "Red Eagles,"
 convicted of killing alleged "collaborators," were given
 multiple life sentences in 1990 for the 1989 murders of eight
 Palestinians. However, much intra-Palestinian violence goes
 unpunished because of the problems of law enforcement in the
 territories, particularly the refusal of many Palestinians to
 cooperate in any way with Israeli investigations. Israelis,
 both civilians and members of the security organizations,
 generally- have received relatively lenient sentences from both
 civilian and military courts for killing Palestinians.
 b. Disappearance
 Israel does not sponsor or condone disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by Israeli law, and Israeli authorities
 assert they do not authorize or condone its use in the
 occupied territories. IDF orders forbid the use of force
 after the detention of a suspect and the cessation of violent
 resistance, although Israeli courts have ruled that "moderate
 physical and psychologicial pressure" during interrogation is
 permissible. Reports continue of harsh and demeaning
 treatment of prisoners under investigation or interrogation,
 as well as beatings of suspects. Critics state that prisoner
 mistreatment takes the form of slaps and blows and similar
 practices, including enforced standing in one position for
 prolonged periods, hooding, sleep.deprivation, cold showers,
 and incarceration in unclean and physically confining spaces.
 These practices reportedly have continued since they were
 confirmed in the 1987 report of the officially appointed
 
 
 1480
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Landau Commission. This Commission condemned "torture," but
 distinguished this from "a moderate measure of physical
 pressure" which it.said is necessary and acceptable in order
 to secure confessions and obtain information from suspects
 concerning terrorism.
 During 1990 Israeli authorities received three complaints of
 Palestinian deaths allegedly attributed to beatings, although
 none of them involved persons in Israeli custody. Israeli
 authorities state that each case is being investigated and
 that-interim findings based on medical reports and testimony
 by family members suggest that the complaints are
 unwarranted. In March two Shin Bet (Israeli state police) �
 officers were charged with the December 1989 beating death of
 a Gazan during interrogation. Their trial continues.
 In 1990 a Palestinian suspect who claimed to have signed a
 confession to murder as a result of beating and other duress
 by Israeli authorities was released when another suspect
 believed to be the actual murderer was arrested.
 Most convictions in security cases are based on confessions.
 An attorney is normally not allowed to see a client until
 after interrogation is completed and a confession, if
 obtained, has been made. Persons may be held up to 14 days
 after arrest before the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) is permitted access.
 According to the IDF, 10,882 Palestinians were being held in
 IDF prisons as of December 31, 1990. Although conditions at
 the Ketziot facility, a major detention center, have improved,
 serious overcrowding continues. Conditions at other detention
 facilities vary. The IDF claims that all meet minimum
 acceptable standards for short-term incarceration and are
 often equal to facilities available for IDF guard forces at
 the detention centers. Some facilities that meet only
 short-term standards are used for long-term detainees.
 Israeli authorities state that 18 or 19 Palestinians in
 Israeli prisons were murdered by other Palestinians during
 1990, primarily for political reasons, and mostly at Ketziot.
 They also state that they have increased security procedures
 to prevent further attacks.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No deportation orders were executed in 1990, but in December,
 despite the urging of the United States and the United Nations
 Security Council, the Government of Israel announced that it
 would resume deportations as a deterrent to intifada
 violence.
 Authorities ordered four Gaza leaders of Hamas (an Islamic
 resistance movement) deported, alleging that they were
 intifada field commanders who had actively incited violence.
 Under relevant decisions of the Israeli High Court,
 deportation orders are subject to judicial review, and, in
 accordance with these rulings, appropriate legal petitions
 were filed in these cases. Defense counsel complained,
 however, of inadequate time to prepare the case and the
 handicap of litigating a case in which the Government's
 evidence is secret (and thus unavailable to the defense). The
 High Court of Justice has never reversed a deportation order.
 The United States considers deportations to contravene Article
 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
 
 
 1481
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Administrative detention for alleged security reasons without
 formal charges declined from 1,271 detainees held at the
 beginning of 1990 to 817 as of September. However, by the end
 of 1990 they had again risen to 1,263. Israeli officials
 state that administrative detention is used only when IDF
 legal advisors have determined that there is sufficient
 evidence to detain a person, and that the evidence has been
 corroborated by two sources, but that the evidence cannot be
 presented in open court because to do so would compromise the
 method of acquiring the evidence, which is often provided by
 informers whose lives would be jeopardized if their identities
 were known. Most administrative detention orders are for 6
 months. The maximum length is 12 months, and several dozen
 Palestinians have been detained on 1-year warrants. Each
 detention order is subject to judicial scrutiny with access by
 the court to all evidence, including secret evidence, and each
 order must be approved by the Minister of Defense. There are
 no restrictions on the number of times an administrative
 detention order may be renewed, but at each renewal, a new
 order must be issued, which is subjected to at least the same
 judicial scrutiny as the original order. Approximately 10
 percent of all detention orders were extended beyond their
 original term. Israel denies imposing administrative
 detention on Palestinains for the expression of political
 views or nonviolent activity, claiming that administrative
 detention is imposed only for activity that is both dangerous
 and serious. However, it broadly defines conspiracy or
 incitement to violence so that in many cases persons appear to
 be arrested for activity which is nonviolent but which
 nevertheless is deemed by Israel as involving participation in
 a conspiracy leading to violent acts.
 District military commanders may order administrative
 detention without formal charges. An order for detention or
 renewal of detention may be appealed to a military judge. In
 appealing detention orders, detainees or their attorneys do
 not have access to secret evidence that may be used against
 them, but they may be informed of its general nature and may
 question security service witnesses concerning the general
 nature of that evidence- Nonsecret evidence may be challenged
 directly. Rulings by military judges may be reviewed by the
 High Court, which also may see the secret evidence. According
 to the IDF, approximately 30 percent of the detention orders-
 appealed in 199a were reduced or reversed on appeal.
 The authorities continued to transfer detainees and prisoners
 out of the occupied territories to detention facilities in
 Israel, especially to the Ketziot camp in the Negev Desert and
 MegiddQ Prison near Afula, about 15 miles from the occupied
 territories in northern Israel. Recause Israel established
 the Ketziot facility, its principal administrative detention
 center, in a "closed military security zone," strict rules
 governing family visits to Ketziot are in effect. Disputes
 between Palestinians and Israeli authorities, including
 Israeli insistence on notification before visitors enter the
 Ketziot military zone and orders by Palestinian leaders
 forbidding family members from having any dealings with CIVAD
 or the IDF, have effectively prevented these visits. Despite
 efforts by the authorities and the ICRC to improve this
 situation and logistic preparations by Israel to accommodate
 up to 20,000 visitors per month, the problem of family visits
 to Ketziot remained unresolved at the end of 1990. In the
 view of the United States, the transfer of prisoners from the
 occupied territories to Israel contravenes Article 76 of the
 Fourth Geneva Convention.
 
 
 1482
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Any soldier may arrest without warrant aiperson who has
 committed, or is suspected of having committed, a criminal or
 security offense. Persons arrested for common crimes in the
 occupied territories are usually provided the opportunity for
 bail,'access to an attorney, anda statement of charges,
 although these rights are sometimes delayed. Bail is rarely
 available to those arrested for security offenses. Persons
 may be held in custody without a warrant for 96 hours and then
 must be released-unless a warrant is issued. A warrant may be
 issued by a police officer for two periods of 7 days each.
 For extensions beyond 18 days from the date of arrest, the
 detainee has to be brought before a military judge, where he
 is entitled to defense counsel. A military judge may extend
 the detention for a period of no longer than 6 months fr6m the
 date of arrest. If there is no indictment during this period,
 the detainee must be released. If there is an indictment, a
 judge may order indefinite detention until the end of the
 trial.
 A detainee has the right to see a lawyer as soon as possible.
 However, in the cases of security detainees, an officer may
 issue.a written order to delay access to counsel for no longer
 than 15 days for reasons of security or the efficiency of
 investigation. Higher ranking officials or judges may extend
 this period by up to 75 more days, for the same reasons. In
 practice, security detainees are usually denied access to a
 lawyer during the initial investigation for periods of a week
 to 15 days.. Israeli regulations also permit prisoners to be
 held in isolation from family and from other detainees during
 interrogation.
 Notification procedures established in 1989 have resulted in
 an improved system of notifying families of arrests and
 incarceration. However, one means of notification (postcards)
 depends on- the postal service, which is unreliable in smaller
 villages of the West Bank. Because of this problem, Israeli
 authorities also post the names of detaineesand those
 transferred to another facility at CIVAD offices. A separate
 notification is made to the ICRC, as well as to the
 appropriate local bar associations. Denial of notification of
 arrest to immediate family members, attorneys, and consular
 officials'under the law may be extended by a senior officer
 for up to 12 days. A military commander may appeal to a judge
 to extend this period in security' cases for an unlimited
 time. While Israeli authorities assert that they attempt to
 post notification within 48 hours, Palestinians assert that
 families and lawyers are normally notified much later and
 often locate the detainee through their own efforts. The ICRC
 generally receives notification 12 days after arrest, with
 access on the 14th day.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Palestinians accused of nonsecurity offenses are tried
 publicly in local courts by Palestinian judges, except where
 jurisdiction has been transferred by military order. However,
 since the beginning of the uprising regular local law
 enforcement has deteriorated seriously. Many Arab policemen
 and judges have quit under orders from the intifada
 leadership, and Palestinian courts have functioned only
 sporadically.
 
 
 1483
 
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Palestinians accused of security offenses are tried in Israeli
 military courts. Serious charges are tried before three-judge
 panels, and defendants are entitled to appeal the judgments of
 such courts as-a matter of right. Charges are brought by
 military prosecutors, and suspects are entitled to counsel.
 Lesser offenses are tried before single-judge courts, and the
 Court of Military Appeals may accept appeals of decisions by
 those courts based on the law applied in the case, the
 sentence imposed, or both. As of October 31, the Military
 Appeals Court had heard 681 appeals. As of that date, 481
 appeals had been completed, of which 335 were accepted and 117
 rejected, with 29 appeals canceled. "Acceptance" of an appeal
 can mean anything from a complete reversal of the prior
 decision to an alteration of the punishment (which could
 include either shortening or lengthening a sentence).
 Articles 64 and 66 of the Fourth Geneva Convention govern
 security offenses that may be tried in military courts.
 Security offenses are sometimes broadly defined by Israel,
 and, as administered, may include charges of Palestinian
 political activity of a nonviolent character. Israeli
 authorities assert that much of the nonviolent political
 activity in question amounts to serving as an accomplice in
 violent or terrorist activities.
 In 199l long delays before trials sometimes occurred because
 military courts are still overburdened by the large numbers of
 uprising-related security cases. To relieve- this court
 congestion, the IDE opened new courts and appointed additional
 judges, which it states have accelerated hearings. The IDF
 reported that by June 1990, 54 percent of Palestinians in
 detention were awaiting trial as against 90 percent in January
 1989-. The IDF also states that it has reduced delays in
 producing defendants for trial, which had been a major factor
 in postponing trials in 1989. Authorities noted that in
 January 1990, over 88 percent of defendants were delivered to
 court as scheduled, and that the average period from the
 filing of a charge sheet to trial was 2 months, except for
 cases involving terrorist charges in which the delay was 1 to
 2 years. An Israeli human rights group observed that in its
 efforts to complete cases more quickly, the military courts
 have adopted expedited trial procedures in which defendants in
 some cases have not had an opportunity to retain an attorney.
 Israeli authorities state that some 3U-40 percent of
 Palestinian defendants plead guilty Under this expedited
 "plea-and-release' process, which usually results in a guilty
 plea and fine in lieu of detention and trial.
 Most military- trials are public, though access is controlled
 and in some cases limited. Consular officers are allowed tor
 attend military court proceedings involving foreign citizens,
 but there have been delays in gaining admission. Acquittals
 are very rare in security cases, with about 96 percent of
 defendants being convicted of the original security charge.
 Charges in security cases can be very general, making it
 difficult for the accused to defend himself. For example,
 charges- may allege involvement in numerous offenses such as
 throwing stones or Molotov cocktails over a period of several
 months, without specifying an exact date or time for each
 incident.
 Most convictions in military courts are based on confessions.
 Physical and psychological pressures, and reduced sentences
 for those who confess, contribute to the likelihood that
 security detainees will sign confessions. Confessions are
 
 
 1484
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 usually recorded in Hebrew, which many defendants are unable
 to read. Israeli- authorities state that confessions are made
 by and repeated to the defendants in Arabic, although they are
 written down in Hebrew because-Israeli court personnel often
 can speak Arabic without being able to write it. Israeli
 authorities assert that they are trying to resolve this
 problem.
 During much of 1990, crowded facilities and arrangements for
 attorney-client consultations in prisons hindered effective
 legal defense efforts. Palestinian attorneys asserted that
 appointments to see clients were difficult to arrange, and
 that prison authorities often failed to produce clients as
 arranged, resulting in delayed consultations. In addition,
 prison authorities often limited the time authorized to meet
 with clients. In September military authorities, prompted by
 a petition to the Israeli High Court, agreed that attorneys
 could bring papers and other defense materials to their
 clients at Ketziot. Prison authorities also improved
 facilities for attorney-client consultations at Ketziot, in
 Gaza, and elsewhere. Israeli authorities claim, and at least
 some Palestinian attorneys agree, that defense lawyers
 generally now have adequate time and acceptable conditions to
 meet with clients.
 Nonjudicial administrative orders of the military government
 may be appealed to area military commanders and to the High
 Court. The IDF confirms that the court has reversed very few
 of the CIVAD or military orders issued on security grounds.
 Israeli settlers in the occupied territories accused of
 security and ordinary criminal offenses are tried in the
 nearest Israeli district court under Israeli law. These
 courts are presided over by civilian judges, and standards of
 due process and admissiblity of evidence are stricter than in
 military courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Military authorities in the occupied territories may enter
 private Palestinian homes and institutions without a warrant
 in pursuit of security objectives. However, new procedures
 require an authorization-by an officer of the rank of
 lieutenant colonel prior to entry. Forced entries are
 regularly used in IDF operations, and are sometimes
 accompanied by beatings and destruction of property. Israeli
 authorities claim that forced entry may lawfully occur only
 incident to arrest when entry is resisted. Beatings and
 arbitrary destruction of property during searches are
 punishable violations of military regulations, and
 compensation is due to victims in such cases. Human rights
 organizations allege that such violations often go
 unpunished. Security officials frequently questioned
 Palestinians about their political activities and temporarily
 detained people.
 During 1990 security authorities demolished 94 houses and
 sealed 83 houses for security reasons. The number of
 demolitions was slightly above that in 1989, when 86 houses
 were demolished, despite Israeli authorities' stated intention
 to employ reversible house sealings more frequently as an
 alternative to demolition. Security forces assert the right
 to demolish or seal the home of a suspect, whether he is the
 owner or only a tenant, a practice that has generated
 
 
 1485
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 litigation by affected landlords. Under the presently applied
 regulations, military commanders may order the demolition or
 sealing of any house from which they suspect a firearm has
 been discharged or bomb thrown, or any house situated in an
 area, town, village, quarter, or street whose inhabitants they
 are satisfied have committed offenses against the
 regulations. Authorities assert (a) that they demolish or
 seal only those houses occupied by Palestinians known to have
 actively participated in a murder or caused serious physical
 injury; and (b) that most such demolitions or sealings are
 aimed at Palestinians who have killed or attempted to kill
 other Palestinians. Owners of houses ordered to be demolished
 have 48 hours to appeal to the area military commander; and
 final appeals may be made to the High Court. In 1990 some 90
 percent of demolition orders were appealed. Of these, 10
 percent in Gaza and about 25 percent in the West Bank were
 changed, although in most cases the order-was altered to a
 sealing. Owners of properties that are demolished or sealed
 are not allowed to rebuild, making the punishment one of
 indefinite duration.
 Following the mob killing of an IDF reservist in al-Bureij
 refugee camp in Gaza in September, the IDF demolished or
 sealed 7 houses and 24 shops and other structures without
 providing owners the 48 hours to appeal. The Israeli High
 Court rejected the claims of Palestinians and human rights
 groups that the demolitions were punitive, and hence entitled
 to the 48-hour appeal period, and accepted the IDF's claim
 that the demolitions were necessary measures required to widen
 the road for security reasons. Military authorities stated
 that compensation will be paid to the owners. As of December,
 compensation had been paid to all but 3 of the approximately
 30 owners. Demolitions usually are carried out prior to the
 trial of the accused. The United States believes the
 demolition or sealing of a home as punishment of families
 contravenes the Fourth Geneva Convention and has urged the
 Israeli Government to end the practice. This type of house
 demolition or sealing-is enforced only against Arab residents
 of the occupied territories.
 Mail and telephone conversations are sometimes monitored.
 Telephone service to specific areas is sometimes interrupted'
 by the authorities for security reasons or in connection. with
 a military operation.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Casualties attributed to- IDF use of standard ammunition and
 rubber and plastic bullets dropped significantly in 1990 as a
 result of a decline in IDF-Palestinian confrontations during
 the first three quarters of the year, more restrained troop
 deployment, and stricter enforcement of the rules of
 engagement concerning- the use of firearms. IDF regulations
 permit the use of standard ammunition only when soldiers'
 lives are in real and immediate danger, to halt fleeing
 suspects, or to disperse a violent demonstration. Only a
 specific attacker may be fired on, except when facing
 immediate danger; fire is to be directed at legs only; and
 fire may be directed at a fleeing suspect only if a serious
 felony is suspected and as a last resort. Soldiers may fire
 at any fleeing masked person, but'may fire standard ammunition
 only after exhausting other methods, including tear gas,
 rubber bullets, and warning shots.
 
 
 1486
 
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 In December the IDF -announced that it had begun to deploy
 hidden snipers to counter stonethrowing and ambushes against
 Israeli,vehicles. -The IDF said that the new tactic did not
 signify a change in -the rules of engagement, although the new
 -policy liberalizes the interpretation of what constitutes a
 .lfes-threatening situation. TheUnited-States opposes the
 practice-as excessive use of force. IDF troops receive little
 training in riot control, and the IDF does not appear to
 maintain sufficient riot-control equipment (i.e., helmets with
 face masks, shields, riot batons,s water cannon, etc.) in its
 inventory.
 Although violent confrontations between Israeli security
 forces andPalestinians declined overall in 1990, serious
 incidents involving the excessive use of force by Israeli
 security personnel continued to occur. The most serious
 :occurred on October 8 when Border Police clashed with
 demonstrators and rock-throwers on the Temple Mount/Haram
 al-Sharif in Jerusalem. In this incident 17 Palestinians were
 .killed and at least 140 wounded. In clashes following the May
 2D murder of 7 Gazan workers by a deranged Israeli civilian at
 Rishon Lezion, 15 Palestinians were killed by IDF gunfire. On
 the whole,-however, IDF troops showed greater restraint ir
 1990 than they;did in 1989 in dealing with confrontations. In
 Gaza, the IDF changed to less frequent but larger patrols,
 which resulted in fewer confrontations with residents. Gaza
 military commanders also required that only officers could
 authorize soldiers to open fire. IDF troops in the West Bank
 also showed more restraint in an effort to avoid confrontations
 Estimates vary of the number of casualties from violence in
 the occupied territories. Figures compiled from press,
 Palestinian, international organization, and Israeli
 Government sources indicate that'a total of 130 Palestinians
 were killed by security forces in 1990, compared to 292 in
 1989; 10 Palestinians were killed by Israeli civilians,
 compared to 11 in 1989; and 165 were killed by other
 Palestinians, significantly more than the 128 in 1989.
 Estimates of the number of Palestinians wounded varies from
 4,000 to over 10,000. IDF figures report approximately 4,500
 Palestinians injured by the security services and 550 injured
 by other Palestinians.
 Figures compiled from the above sources indicate that 10
 Israelis were killed by Palestinians and at least 212 Israeli
 civilians.were injured in the occupied territories during
 1990, fewer than in 1989. The IDF reports that 1,340 Israeli
 security personnel and 413-Israeli civilians were injured by
 Palestinians in 1990.
 There were many charges of unjustified beatings and physical
 abuse.by Israeli security forces. However, the number of
 complaints of such beatings declined in 1990. The IDF states
 that eveiy fatality is automatically investigated. Nonlethal
 violent incidents are not routinely investigated unless a
 complaint is made, and then, due both to the volume of
 incidents and lack of-cooperation by Palestinians, not all
 complaints are fully investigated. Investigations into fatal
 incidents are lengthy, so that investigations begun in the
 early months of the uprising are only now being completed.
 Human rights-organizations charge that the IDF does not make
 sufficient effort to obtain testimony from Palestinian
 witnesses, while the IDF states that Pales.tinians refuse to
 cooperate with its investigations. The IDF reports that as a
 result of its investigations into soldiers' conduct, 40 charge
 
 
 1487
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 sheets were filed against 55 soldiers in 1990. Other cases
 were sent to unit commanders for consideration of disciplinary-
 action below the level of court-martial.
 Not all inve tigations result in discipi-ina-4 action. When
 disciplinary actions were taken in death cases, either
 administrative or judicial, some punishments appeared
 lenient. For example, soldiers were often disciplined for
 lesser charges, such as improper use of weapons rather than
 the more serious charges of murder dr manslaughter, especially
 in cases in which several soldiers were involved but the death
 could not be attributed to a specific soldier or the precise
 cause of death could not bs legally established.
 In August the Judge Advocate General's office explained to an
 Israeli human rights organization that no disciplinary action
 could be brought against a soldier who allegedly shot a
 13-year-old girl in the Dahaishe refugee camp in April 1989
 because the body had been buried by the family before an
 autopsy could be performed and consequently no legal
 connection between the girl's death and the shots could be
 made.
 In June an IDF officer threw a tear gas grenade into the door
 of the waiting room of a Gaza United Nations Relief and Works
 Agency clinic where between 100 and 200 women and babies were
 present. IDF authorities immediately acknowledged the officer
 had acted contrary to orders, and disciplined him with 10 days
 of detention. However, the detention order was reversed by
 the commanding officer.
 Four Givati.Brigade soldiers were convicted of the August 1988
 beating of a Gaza resident who later died. They were
 convicted of abuse rather than murder or manslaughter because
 the victim's body had been taken from the hospital and buried
 before the cause of death could be legally established. The
 battalion commander, a major, was demoted to lieutenant and
 sentenced to 5 months' suspended imprisonment, a captain was
 demoted to sergeant and sentenced to 8 months' imprisonment
 (of which 6 months was suspended), and two sergeants were
 demoted to private and sentenced to 5 months' suspended
 imprisonment.
 Following a 1989 petition to the High Court by an Israeli
 human rights organization, a court-martial was held in 1990
 for an IDF colonel who had previously received relatively mild
 discipline, for orderin% his troops to break the bones of
 Palestinians. The trial had not yet concluded at year's end.
 IDF use of tear gas has continued to be controversial. Misuse
 declined in Gaza in 1990, as commanders there used it
 primarily to disperse demonstrators. However, allegations
 continue of misuse by the IDF in the West Bank and especially
 by the Border Police in East Jerusalem. The IDF states it has
 not received any allegations of death attributed to improper
 use of tear gas in 1990, while Palestinian human rights
 organizations claimed there were such deaths.
 Reports of serious incidents of Israeli interference with
 medical care have declined in 1990, due partly to the reduced
 number of confrontations and to better IDF discipline. The
 IDF continued to enter hospitals'and clinics on security
 grounds and to stop ambulances in search of suspects.
 Sometimes, ambulances have been used to transport uninjured
 
 
 1488
 
 ISRAEL'AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Palestinians away from an area of confrontation, leading to
 Israeli charges that ambulances are used to evade pursuit of
 those suspects.
 The IDF sometimes imposed temporary curfews on, or created
 closed military areas in, towns or villages in order to
 facilitate the collection of taxes from Palestinians.
 Authorities assert that they face widespread opposition to tax
 payment, vhich necessitates extraordinary collection methods.
 Palestinians claim that these measures are excessive and that
 -such factics are not used in Israel. Palestinian residents of
 the occupied territories do not have recourse to the Israeli
 judicial system which serves as the arbiter of tax disputes
 within Israel; rather, appeals must be made to a special
 review board appointed by the military commander.
 Palestinians may petition the High Court for redress of any
 administrative action.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. 'Freedom of Speech and Press
 East Jerusalem is an active center of Arabic publication,
 including of newspapers. There is no press published, in the
 West Bank or Gaza, but Jerusalem papers are distributed
 there. Israeli authorities impose tight restrictions on the
 Arabic press, citing broadly defined security reasons.
 Publications in East Jerusalem must submit to military
 authorities for prior censorship all copy relating to the
 security, public order, and safety of Israel and the occupied
 territories. Some reports and editorials related to the
 'uprising and Palestinian political goals were permitted, but
 articles and editorials were also routinely expurgated.
 Arabic translations of news stories related to the uprising,
 including items that had previously appeared in the
 Hebrew-language press, were routinely censored from the Arabic
 press on security grounds such as incitement to violence.
 The display of Palestinian political symbols, such as flags,
 national colors, and graffiti, is punishable by stiff fines
 (usually the equivalent of $175 for graffiti), detention, or
 imprisonment. Palestinians are at times forced to erase
 graffiti found by security forces,, regardless of whether they
 are responsible for it. Public expression of support for the
 Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), its component
 factions (such as Fatah), Islamic extremist groups (such as
 Hamas), and other banned organizations is prohibited.
 No broadcast media originates from the occupied territories.
 The authorities have jammed radio broadcasts from neighboring
 countries that they deemed inflammatory. In December a
 prominent Palestinian press service, which had been allowed to
 reopen in March and which submitted its product to the
 government censors, was closed for publishing a newspaper
 without a license. This was the second closure of a press
 service in Jerusalem in 1990. In September a press service
 allegedly affiliated with the Democratic Front for the
 Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) was ordered to stop
 disseminating an unlicensed newsletter.
 In July Israel closed.,two offices of a well-known Arab studies
 society and extended the closure order on a third office
 because of the society's alleged role as a.center for Fatah
 field operations. More than 33 Palestinian journalists were
 arrested in 1990 on security charges such as filming in a
 
 
 1489
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 closed military area. Numerous other-journalists were
 interrogated, press offices were raided, and occasionally
 phones were cut off in connection with Israeli security
 investigations. At least three journalists complained of
 being beaten while attempting to cover the news. .Israeli
 authorities deny that anyone is arrested for writing news
 stories or acting as a press service and state that
 journalists are subject to the same laws as all other
 Palestinians.
 A permit is required to import publications into the occupied
 territories, and imported materials may be censored or banned
 for anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli content, support for the
 intifada or Palestinian nationalism, or when deemed a threat
 to state security. In February Israeli censors banned the
 import of a U.S.-based newsletter because it allegedly
 encouraged continuing violence in the occupied territories.
 Possession of banned materials, such as uprising leaflets, is
 punishable by fine and imprisonment. The IDF periodically
 declared all or pprts of the West Bank and Gaza closed
 military areas, one effect of which was to exclude journalists
 except under military escort. Peports by foreignJournalists
 are subject to censorship under a system of self-regulation.
 In 1990 Israel began to lift some of the closure orders that
 had affected West Bank and Gaza colleges and universities
 since the beginning of the uprising. In June Israel allowed
 the Arab College of Health Professions in al-Bireh to reopen,
 and in July the technical college of Abu Dis (both affiliated
 with al-Quds university) was allowed to reopen. West Bank
 community colleges and vocational'schools reopened in 1990.
 Bethlehem University reopened in October. The other four West
 Bank and Gaza universities remained close.d. Off-campus
 university programs'were banned on security grounds, but an
 underground system operated throughout the year. Secondary
 and elementary schools in the West Bank reopened in January,
 although some remained closed for extended periods.
 Authorities continued to close individual schools for short'
 periods in reaction to alleged security problems emanating
 from those- schools.� Schools in Gaza and East Jerusalem were
 open for most of the school year, although all schools in the
 West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem were closed temporarily
 following the October 8 Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif
 incident. Schools are also closed 3 to 4 days each month
 because of the observance of Palestinian "strike days."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Military orders ban public gatherings of 10 or more people
 without a permit. Political parties and other groups are
 banned, including some labor unions viewed as being affiliated
 with banned organizations such as the PLO. Private
 organizations are supposed to be registered with the CIVAD,
 though some operate without either licenses or interference
 from Israeli authorities. Palestinian charitable, community,
 professional, and self-help organizations are permitted to
 operate unless their activities are viewed as overtly
 political or as endangering security or supporting the
 uprising. Persons involved in intifada activities are often
 arrested, interrogated, administratively detained, or denied
 permission to travel, regardless pf their profession or
 affiliation.

 anG           O'd~walthough the nun~rof ci rfews' and
 therf dur tibn deolsied an 2990     In Gaza, there has been a
 nightly curfew sictke :the beginning of the uprising. This
 curfew        4 was upheld b  the High Court of Justice.  Night curfews
 that lied bpen in force inJenin and  h    Dahaishe refugee camp
 every ngh    since August and Septemb& er 1989, respectively,
 were lifted on March 27 in response to a High Court petition
 biought  y "an Israeli civil rights organization.   Duringa
 curfews, people were usually allowed to leave their houses to
 obtain food and medical care for short, defined periods.       On
 several occasions authorities closed the West Bank and Gaza
 completely for securi  y reasons to prevent access by
 Palestinians to East Jerusalem and Israel.
 Following an Israeli human rights organizations petition to
 the High Court, the authorities agreed to lift collective
 travel bans that had been imposed on the residents of 25 West
 Bank villages, some for as long as 2 years. Despite th High
 Courts ruling in that case, the Israeli Government in
 September imposed a travel ban on the residents of three West
 Bank villages.
 A 6-month ban on entry into Israel was issued against most
 working age males who live in the al-Bureij refugee camp in
 Gaza following the murder there of an IDF reservist in
 September. Indictments have been issued against individual
 suspects in this case, but the ban remains for the others.
 Approximately 15,000 Palestinians are affected by the
 Government's issuance of distinctive identity cards which
 prohibit the bearer from entering or transiting Israel or East
 Jerusalem. These cards have been issued for several years to
 Palestinians considered to be security risks. In November the
 Government began to issue several thousand more such cards to
 any Palestinian ever detained or incarcerated. Some of those
 who received such cards at that time claim to have been
 administratively detained for their political views. Others,
 including lawyers, human rights organization employees, and
 journalists, say they had never been arrested or
 administratively detained. Such identity cards not only
 prevent Palestinians from working in Israel or East Jerusalem,
 but also from visiting the many key Palestinian institutions
 
 
 1491
 
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 located there, such as hospitals, schools, and religious
 institutions.
 Thousands of Palestinians in the occupied territories travel
 abroad each year. Citing security concerns, Israel has
 imposed travel restrictions on some political activists. The
 United States has protested a number of these travel bans to
 the Israeli Government. There were numerous cases in which
 young men were denied permission to travel unless they agreed
 to remain abroad for an extended time. All Palestinian males
 between the ages of 16 and 35, for example, generally must
 stay outside the occupied territories at least 9 months if
 they cross the bridge into Jordan. unless special permission
 for a 1-month stay has been obtained in advance. Palestinians
 must obtain several different clearances in order to obtain a
 travel permit. Israeli authorities sometimes prevented
 Palestinians with permits from crossing the bridge without
 offering a reason or revoked the traveler's permit on asserted
 security grounds. According to figures from the Islamic Waqf,
 all Muslims who applied were permitted to make the pilgrimage
 (hajj) in 199a.
 There are no obstacles to emigration. Israel sometimes
 refuses to renew laissez-passers of Palestinians from the
 occupied territories who live or work abroad on the grounds
 that they have abandoned their residence, even though they may
 not have acquired foreign citizenship. Palestinians who
 obtain foreign citizenship are ordinarily not allowed to
 resume residence in the occupied territories; those who
 acquire the right to residence elsewhere, or who remain
 outside the territories for more than 3 years are often also
 not permitted to resume residence in the territories. They
 are permitted to return only as tourists and sometimes are
 denied entry entirely. Enforcement of the 3-month limit for
 tourist visas for Palestinians is uneven. Permanent residency
 permission is usually denied to foreign-born spouses and
 foreign-born children of Palestinian residents of the occupied
 territories, although they are allowed to reside as temporary
 residents with renewable permits.
 Many Palestinians abroad during the 1967 war, or who have lost
 their residence permits for other reasons, are not generally
 permitted to return to reside permanently with their
 families. According to Israeli authorities, in 1990 some 326
 family reunification applications were approved for
 Palestinians to reside in the West Bank and Gaza and 269 were
 rejected. Adjudication of these applications is at the
 discretion of the CIVAD. Israeli officials acknowledge that
 family reunification is limited for demographic and political
 reasons. They assert that the laws of occupation do not
 require Israel to permit the return of former Palestinian
 residents who were abroad in 1967 or who have lost their
 residency status by protracted absence and relocation of
 domicile, even if they were born in the territories.
 Restrictions on residence, tourist visas, reentry, and family
 reunification do not apply to Jews resident in the occupied
 territories, whether or not they are Israeli citizens.
 In June, in response to a petition to the High Court, Israel
 decided to allow foreign wives and minor children, deported in
 1989 for overstaying tourist visas, to return to the West
 Bank. In addition, the Government stated that it would allow
 these women and their minor children, as well as those in
 illegal status who had not been deported, to remain in the
 
 
 1492
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 West Bank on extended tourist visas. (Foreign husbands of
 Palestinian residents generally will not be covered by this
 decision.) The Government has not agreed to provide these
 Palestinians with permanent residency rights that would
 guarantee them the fight to travel and return and access to
 local health and educational resources, although it has said
 it does consider humanitarian cases on an individual basis.
 'Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The West Bank and Gaza are governed under occupation by
 Israel's Ministry of Defense through a military government and
 civil administration. Palestinians have no means to
 participate in most significant policy decisions concerning
 land and resource use and planning, taxation, trade, and
 industry. Municipal elections were last held in 1976 in the
 .West Bank, and-most mayors elected then were later dismissed,
 and some deported, on security grounds. Palestinians
 appointed by Israel have filled most vacancies. Some
 appointed mayors, however, have resigned or stopped working
 because of the uprising and threats from other Palestinians.
 East'Jerusalem is governed as part of Israel. Arab residents
 of East Jerusalem are permitted'to vote in municipal elections
 but have largely boycotted them at the direction of
 Palestinian leaders. No Arab resident of East Jerusalem sits
 on the city council. In the last municipal election in 1989,
 less than 5 percent of Jerusalem's Arab population voted.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human'Rights
 Israel normally permits international human rights groups to
 visit the occupied territories. Israel actively cooperates
 with a number of such organizations, and officials are
 generally available for meetings on human rights issues.
 Israel, however, refused to accept a United Nations mission to
 investigate the October 8 incident at Temple Mount/Haram
 al-Sharif. Many local groups--Israeli, Palestinian, and
 mixed--are concerned with human rights. Their publications
 and statements are generally allowed to circulate in the
 occupied territories. They are allowed to hold press
 conferences.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Israeli law has been extended to cover most activities of
 Israeli settlers who live in the occupied territories, while
 Palestinians live under military occupation law. Under the
 dual system of governance, Palestinians--both Muslim and
 Christian--are treated less favorably than Israeli settlers on
 a broad range of issues, including the right to due process,
 right of residency, freedom of movement, sale of crops and
 goods, land and water use, and availability of health and
 social services. Israeli settlers involved in security
 violations have been treated far more leniently than
 Palestinians accused of similar offenses. Offenses against
 Israelis are investigated and prosecuted more vigorously than
 offenses against Palestinians, due in part, Israeli
 authorities claim, to Palestinian refusal,to cooperate with
 investigating authorities. Israeli agriculture and
 
 
 1493
 
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 manufacturing are protected against Palestinian competition
 from the territories, whereas all markets in the territories
 are theoretically open to Israelis, subject to extensive
 Palestinian boycotts.
 Israeli citizens have been accorded the right to reside in the
 occupied territories under Israel's Law of Return.
 Palestinians who were born in the territories but live abroad
 and have lost, according to Israeli laws and regulations,
 their right to reside in the territories may regain the right
 to reside and be reunited with their families only with
 permission of the Israeli occupation authorities.
 Israel continued to place land under its control for military
 purposes, roads, settlement of Israelis, and other purposes
 which restrict use by Palestinians and discriminate in favor
 of Israeli settlers against Palestinians. Permits are tightly
 restricted for new Palestinian housing construction in the
 occupied territories and for expanding town boundaries for
 development to meet population growth- Palestinians do not
 participate in the Higher Planning Council, the Regional
 Planning and Building Committee in Gaza, or their
 subcommittees, which plan land use in the occupied
 territories, issue permits, and exercise planning powers that
 were transferred from local, municipal, and village councils
 in 1971. In 1990- the authorities demolished approximately 150
 houses in the West Bank which were built without licenses. An
 Israeli human rights organization estimated that at least
 2,000 new housing permits a year are needed to accommodate
 Palestinian housing needs in the West Bank, and the low number
 of new housing permits has been a standing complaint by
 Palestinians. CIVAD officials assert they are taking steps-to
 improve the situation and issued 712 permits in 1990, up from
 approximately 200 in 1989. The CIVAD provides basic services
 for Palestinians under occupation. There is no public
 accounting of its revenue and expenditure in the occupied
 territories.
 Palestinians and persons of Arab descent entering the West
 Bank via the Jordan River bridges, regardless of citizenship,
 are often subject to extensive searches, including strip
 searches, and many complain of harsh or humiliating
 treatment. Israel limits the funds that Palestinian residents
 may bring into the occupied territories to about $300 per
 person per month without official permission and about $600
 with advance notice. There are no limits on funds that
 Israeli settlers may bring into the territories.
 There is no legal discrimination against women. Violence
 against women is not legally condoned. The participation rate
 of women in the labor force is low, and they are employed
 primarily in traditional professions and occupations, although
 there are exceptions. Women's societies flourish and play an
 important social role.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 The applicable sections for West Bank and Gaza Palestinians
 working in Israel are contained in the country report for
 Israel.
 a. The Right of Association
 The labor law in the West Bank is Jordanian Law no. 21 of
 1960, as amended by military orders. It permits workers to
 
 
 1494
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 joln unions without government authorization. It also permits
 the formation of unions by any group of 20 or more from the
 same trade or workplace, with prior government authorization.
 The 1990 report of the the International Labor Organization
 (IO) Director General noted that Israeli authorities have
 approved no new union applications since 1979. No petitions
 were submitted in 1990. Approximately 31 of the 90 labor
 unions that function in the West Bank are officially licensed.
 The labor law in Gaza is Egyptian Military Order 331, which
 supplements the prior British Mandate labor law and which has
 been amended by Israeli military orders. It allows the
 organization of unions on a workplace or craft basis.
 However, the Israeli authorities barred unions from operating
 in Gaza until 1979. Since 1979, unions have been permitted to
 operate under strictly enforced restrictions that, among other
 things, prevent elections of new union leaders and opening of
 branch offices. As'a result, only the seven unions-that
 existed in 1967 operate in Gaza, out of one office in Gaza
 City.'
 Palestinian*,residents of East Jerusalem are governed by the
 same law as workers in Israel and are free to establish their
 own labor unions. Israeli authorities officially bar East
 Jerusalem unions from joining the West Bank trade union
 federations,-though this restriction has not been enforced.
 Individual Palestinian workers in East Jerusalem may belong to
 both local unions,'some of which are affiliated with a West
 Bank federation, -nd the Israeli Histadrut labor federation.
 Israeli authorities itate that the West Bank umbrella
 federation� and many individual unions are not legitimate
 trade unions but rather fronts for illegal political
 organizations. Citing security concerns, the authorities
 actively discourage many activities by unions in' the West Bank
 and Gaza. Israel states that no legitimate union activities
 ar disrupted and that Israeli actions are intended to prevent
 illicit political activity. The 1990 report of the ILO
 Director General, however, complains that Israeli officials
 often do not substantiate these claims.
 More than 100,000 West Bank Palestinians, representing a full
 range of blue-collar and white-collar professionals, were
 members of approximately 90 trade unions in 1990. The great
 majority of West Bank unions belong to either the General
 Federation of Trade Unions in the West Bank (GFTU) or the
 General Federation of Trade Unions in the West Bank - Workers'
 Unity Bloc (WUB), which supports the Democratic Front for the
 Liberation of Palestine. The split in the GFTU, which took
 place in 1981, was significantly healed in 1990 when all
 factions except the WUR reunified under the leadership of a
 pro-Fatah secretary general. The GFTU participates in
 meetings of the International Confederation of Arab Trade
 Unions and has observer status in the Communist-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), although it is
 notformally affiliated to either. Both the GFTU and the WUB
 have applied for membership in the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The West Bank unions are
 independent of the Government of Israel and do not have
 fraternal relations with the Israeli Histadrut labor
 federation.
 Military Order 825 of 1980, officially applied in the West
 Bank and unofficially in Gaza, requires that Palestinian
 unions present lists of candidates for union office to the
 
 
 1495
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 CIVAD for approval 30 days before elections. The order
 authorizes the CIVAD to remove from the lists any candidates
 who have been convicted of a felony, including those sentenced
 for security-related offenses. The CIVAD has said that it
 will enforce this order by disallowing the election of
 candidates not approved in advance. Because Palestinian trade
 unionists fear that the CIVAD will use the order to exclude
 those candidates who have served in administrative detention,
 they refuse to adhere to the order and hold elections at the
 workplace level without the approval of the authorities. The
 GFTU has petitioned the ICFTU to intervene with the Israeli
 authorities to allow federation-level elections and to act as
 observers at such elections.
 Like all organizations in the occupied territories,
 Palestinian labor unions are subject to disciplinary measures
 for engaging in political and security-related activities.
 All meetings of 10 or- more non-Israeli citizens in the
 occupied territories must have prior CIVAD approval. The
 CIVAD has invoked this requirement to break up many union
 meetings that were held without prior approval in the past
 year. The CIVAD also raided and forced the temporary closure
 of at least two union offices in the West Bank in 1990, though
 the GFTU central office in Nablus reopened in August after the
 expiration of a 2-year CIVAD closure order.
 Union leaders have been among those detained for alleged
 security offenses. The WUB leadership has been particularly
 subjected to such detentions. In addition, many union leaders
 and representatives have been denied permission to travel
 abroad in 19 9. to attend trade union conferences and training
 programs. The Secretary General of the GFTU was permitted to
 travel to both the ILO Conference in Geneva and the WFTU
 Congress in Moscow in 1990. The GFTU Secretary General of the
 GFTU and other members of GFTU's executive committee were
 issued green identity cards in December, prohibiting entry
 into East Jerusalem where the GFTU has a large office. Other
 union officials reportedly alsor received green identity cards.
 There has been no dissolution of unions by administrative or
 legislative action. Under prevailing labor law, unions have
 the right to strike only after submitting a complaint to the
 CIVAD for mandatory arbitration. N strikes have been
 authorized under this procedure. However, authorities have
 not interfered with unauthorized strikes called over strictly
 labor issues. More such strikes took place in the West Bank
 in 1990 than iif previous years, owing to the worsening
 economic situation of West Bank worker.- Widescale or local
 "strikes" called by Palestinian factions to- promote the
 intifada are not labor actions.
 Palestinian unions in the occupied territories are barred from
 organizing the thousands of Palestinian workers who have jobs
 in rsrael (whose work conditions are described in the worker
 rights section of the Israel country report).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Applicable labor. 9aws in the occupied territories protect
 collective bargajidng. The CIVAD does not record collective
 agreements because some unions and some union leaders are not
 legally recognized. However, most union-employer agreements
 ate honored without interference from the authorities, and the
 number of such agreements in force has increased over the past
 year. The only forum for labor grievances in the West Bank
 
 
 1496
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 legal systdn is the CIVAD's military court system.
 Palestinians view the system as unsympathetic and prefer to
 -use the traditional techniqud 'of mediation by community
 notables.--
 There are no export processing zones in the occupied
 territories.
 -   c. ,Prohibition df Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced dr compulsory labor in the occupied
 territories.
 .d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 A 1978 military order-raised the minimum working age in the
 West-Bahk and Gazb'tb 14, though this order is not effectively
 enforced and underage labor is used in the agricultural sector
 and in some West Bank and Gaza factories.
 e.-.-Acceptable Conditibns of Work
 r-In the" West Bank, Jordanian law -prescrbes a maximum workweek
 of 48 hours; except for certain hotel, food service, and
 cinema employees, whose workweek is 54 hours. In Gaza,
 Israeli authorities amended this law to provide for a 45-hour
 workweek for day--laborers and a 40-hour week for salaried
 employees. There is no effective enforcement of maximum
 wbrkweek laws. There is no minimum wage provision in the West
 Bank or Gaza. The Ministry of Labor's inspection service is
 charged with enforcing health and'safety standards in-the West
 Bank anid Gaza. The Ministry of Labor Report'(Annex 2 of the
 1990 ILO Report) claims that about 15 labor inspectors visit
 each plant in the occupied territories at least once a year;
 while Palestitian sources'state that Ministry of Labor
 inspectors stopped visiting WestBank factories during the,
 last 3 years of the intifada. According to international
 labor organizations, health and safety conditions in some
 factories do not meet industry standards established by the
 ILO;'
