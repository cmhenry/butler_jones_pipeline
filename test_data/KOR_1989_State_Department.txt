 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The Republic of Korea (ROK) is moving away from its
 authoritarian past and has made great strides towards
 attaining full democracy. However, the process of
 consolidating democratic institutions and practices is still
 ongoing. In December 1987, Roh Tae Woo became Korea's first
 directly elected President since 1971, defeating three
 opposition candidates. In the April 1988 legislative
 elections, the three opposition parties together gained
 majority control of the National Assembly. Since that time,
 the power of the Presidency has been reduced and the role of
 the National Assembly greatly enhanced. The current National
 Assembly is more independent of the Executive. than were
 previous assemblies.
 Korea's-powerful security services were noticeably less active
 during 1988 than they had been in the past. However, their
 activities increased again in 1989. From April through June,
 the Government temporarily grouped representatives of the
 security ageicies into the Joint Security Investigations
 Headquarters (JSIH). During this period, several hundred
 people were arrested for.alleged security law violations. The
 arrests continued after the JSIH was-.disbanded in June. While
 the police.-are relatively well trained and disciplined, there
 were credible reports of the use of excessive force in a
 number of instances.
 After 3 years of unprecedented 12 percent annual GNP growth,
 Korea's' eyzgrt-driven-economy slowed somewhat to a still
 healthy projected rate of 6 to 7 pekcent for 1989. Tensions
 in labor-management relations continued, while urban housing
 shortages, rural migration to the cities, and unbalanced
 regional development:continued to pose problems. However,
 increasing domestic demand suggested continuing strong growth.
 In 1988 President Roh released several hundred political
 prisoners and.the overall human rights situation improved
 greatly. However, over the course of 1989,-the National
 Security Law and the Law on Assembly and Demonstrations were
 used with increasing frequency against dissidents- Some
 prisoners held on security charges or for labor law violations
 were prevented from meeting with their lawyers. There were
 some credible allegations of torture. The National Assembly
 abolished the Social Safety Act but failed to amend the
 .controversial National Security Law and the Law on the Agency
 for National Security Planning (NSP,-formerly the KCIA).
 Nevertheless, on balance Korea remains a much more tolerant
 and open society than in the past. In particular, a
 boisterous free press that frequently criticizes the
 Government ensures that allegations of human rights violations
 are widely publicized.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no documented cases of political killings by the
 security forces in 1989. However, some dissident and student
 activists have raised questions about the suspicious deaths of
 two student leaders. In two cases, students were responsible
 for deaths in connection with their political activities. In
 May seven riot policemen x4ere killed while trying to free
 
 
 886
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 colleagues being held hostage by students in Pusan. In
 October six student radicals beat to death a suspected student
 informer.
 On the night-of May.3, police in Kwangju stopped a taxi
 carrying wanted student activist Lee Chol Kyu. Lee allegedly
 escaped from the police in the area of a nearby reservoir.
 One week later his body-was found floating in the reservoir.
 An autopsy resulted in a conclusion of death by accidental
 drowning. Some students and dissident activists claimed that
 Lee was actually tortured and murdered. However, they
 provided no persuasive evidence to back their claim. The
 activists' attempt to bring a U.S. specialist to do a second
 autopsy.as requested by Lee's parents was initially approved
 by the Government. However, the Government later ordered the
 American doctor not to examine the body because to do so, the
 Government claimed, would have been a violation of the
 doctor's visa status.
 In August the body of another student leader was found in the
 water off the southern coast. The government coroner ruled it
 the result of accidental drowning, but in October opposition
 members of the National Assembly raised questions about the
 circumstances of the death and demanded that the Government
 undertake a new investigation. By year's end, the Government
 had completed its new investigation, confirming the original
 conclusion of accidental death.
 The seven policemen who were.killed in Pusan in:,early May had
 been storming a university building in whicIr student
 dissidents held five policemen hostage in a bid to-have fellow
 students released from jail. ,When the police stormed the
 building, one student igni-ted afire that resulted in the
 deaths of the seven policemen. Seventy-one-students were
 tried; 35 received suspended sentences while the others
 received sentences up to life imprisonment. Students and
 supporters, angered by the sentences, stormed and occupied the
 university president's office for 3 days before retreating.
 In mid-October,-six students at Yonsei University abducted a
 student they accused of being an informer and beat-him to
 death. The six eventually turned themselves in to the-police
 and have been charged with murder. A trial was pending at
 year's end.
 ,In separate incidents in June, two.J:riminal-suspects died
 shortly after being-taken into police-custody. Witnesses said
 that both men died after being beaten by the police. Nine
 people, including seven policemen, were arrested and charged
 in connection with these two deaths. The seven policemen and
 one civilian security guard were convicted. One policeman was
 sentenced to 5 years in prison; the other defendants were
 given 3-year sentences.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no documented cases of permanent rdisappearances
 during 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Some credible allegations of torture were made during the last
 half of 1989 by persons arrested under the National Security
 Law. They claimed that they were tortured while being
 
 
 887
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 interrogated by the NSP or the prosecutors. The alleged
 mistreatment reportedly includedacute sleep deprivation,
 being forced to stand during-long periods of questioning,
 verbal abuse, biatings, and the forced administration of
 drugs.
 .In convicting former National Assemblyman Suh Kyong Won of
 espionage in December, the court rejected Sub's claim that he
 was tortured into making a confession (Section l.e). Suh's
 aide was also convicted of espionage. In the aide's case, the
 judges 'did not rule out the possibility that he was mistreated
 while ifiicustody.
 In late October, an official of the Ministry of Finance was
 acquitted on charges of taking-a bribe when the judge
 determined Ehat the official had been tortured into making
 false statements. The official had testified that prosecution
 investigators had repedtedly beat him in the .face and head in
 order-to make him confess.'
 Regarding a January 1987 police torture case, the Seoul
 District Civil Court in November orderhd the Government and a
 number of police"6fficials to pay about $194,000 in
 compensation to the'father of student activist Park Chong
 �Chol, who died during police'interrogation.
 The police apparently employed excessive force on some
 occasions throughout 1989. In-Augusre a group of teachers
 collecti-nghsignatures supporting 'their effort to form a union
 were reportedly dragged into a pol-ice"bus and'-beaten with iron
 rods 'wiapdd in newspaper. -On August 20, several
 ' emonstratofs were beaten, and four'6f-them injuned by police
 on the-'*rounds-'6f Chonju's Catholic-Cathedral. The police
 asserted that they went onto the cathedral grounds because the
 .demonstratbrs -were throwing rocks at them. ThroUghout mosf'of
 the year, student-protesters threw-rocks and firebombs at
 .police in demonstrations, except for a 4-week period in May
 following'the deaths of the tseven Pusan policemen.
 Conditions"In Korean prisons have i-eportedly improved
 somewhat. However, a report of the-Government's Board of
 Audit and Inspection revealed a serious-shortage of medical
 personnel in.the prison system. Moreover, -human rights
 .activists still claimed that political prisoners were
 sometimes subjected to:sleep deprivation and psychological
 pressure.
 d. ;Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Rob administration, Koreans are freer to criticize
 the Government than in the past. Nonetheless, over the course
 of 1989, the National Security Law was used with increasing
 frequency against people who expressed views the Government
 considered dangerous. From April through June, the JSIH
 investigated alleged security cases and arrested several
 hundred persons.
 The Government acknowledges that 2,094 people were arrested on
 "security-related charges" from the beginning of President
 Roh's administration in-February 1988 until the end of August
 1989. More than half (1,315)-were arrested since the
 beginning of 1989, including 284-for violating the National
 Security Law. This represents a substantial increase over the
 779 similar arrests recorded in the 10 months of Roh's
 
 
 888
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 administration in 1988, none of which were for violations of
 the National Security Law.
 According to the National Police, during the first 18 months
 of the Roh Government, 190 people were arrested for publishing
 or possessing books or articles originating in or praising
 Communist North Korea, 15 for seeking contact with North
 Koreans, and 37 for association with "antistate
 organizations." In addition, approximately 35 teachers were
 arrested in connection with attempts to form a teachers'
 union. Union organizers were arrested for trying to exercise
 the right of assembly. Allegedly, 150 to 200 trade unionists
 were arrested on various charges in 1989.
 A major step forward in the human rights area in 1989 was the
 National Assembly's decision in May to abolish the Social
 Safety Act (also referred to as the Public Security Law), long
 opposed because of its broad authority to keep under
 surveillance or in custody persons who had completed their
 sentences for sedition, espionage, or other security
 violations. Disposition of cases under the Social Safety Act
 were administrative in nature, and the normal rules of
 criminal procedure did not apply; there were limited appeal
 rights. The 35 people held under the Act in the Chonju
 Preventive Detention Center were all released by the end of
 the year.
 The Assembly also revised the Act for the Protection of
 Society, which allows for preventive detention of habitual
 criminals. The revised law more clearly.defines those who may
 be kept in protective custody, leaves the decision on whether
 to impose a custody order in the hands of judges and not
 administrative authorities, and requires yearly review of each
 detention order. The Government announced that 1,200 of the
 4,407 people held under this Act would be released by the end
 of 1989. (In fact, 225 people were released.)
 Warrants are required by law in cases of arrest, detention,
 seizure, or search, unless a criminal is apprehended while in
 the act of committing a crime. However, lawyers state that
 warrants were not presented at the time of detention in many
 cases throughout 1989. In some political cases, suspects were
 detained for more than the legal limit of 48 hours without
 being formally arrested. (Student activist Im Su Kyong, who
 visited North Korea without government permission, was
 detained on August 15 and not charged until August 20.) In
 criminal cases indictments must be handed down within 30 days
 of arrest or 50 days in National Security Law cases. However,
 these requirements were not always observed.
 The Constitution specifically provides the right to
 representation by an attorney, but attorneys are not allowed
 to be present during interrogation. Lawyers say that in
 National Security Law cases they are very rarely allowed to
 see their clients at all during the investigation phase, which
 can last up to 50 days. In 1989 lawyers for the first time
 sought court orders allowing them to see their clients.
 However, on at least three occasions in July and August,
 either the National Security Planning Agency or the prosecutor
 refused to respect court orders calling on them to allow
 prisoners arrested under the National Security Law to meet
 with their attorneys. On September 1, the Government proposed
 to the National Assembly an amendment to the National Security
 Law which would legalize the prosecqtor's current de facto
 control over when, where, and for how long lawyers are allowed
 
 
 889
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 to see clients being investigated for security law
 violations. The National Assembly has not yet acted on this
 proposal.
 There is a functioning system of bail in Korea. Late in the
 year bail was even granted in some National Security Law
 cases. In early November, a Seoul judge granted bail to a
 student activist who had been arrested for distributing
 "materials benefiting North Korea," without having received a
 bail request.from the defendant. Later in the month three
 minor figures, in the Suh Kyung Won case were also released on
 bail. The right to a judicial determination of the legality
 of a person's detention was deleted from the Code of Criminal
 Conduct in 1973, partially restored in 1980, and then fully
 restored in late 1987.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution gives defendants a number of rights in
 criminal trials  including a presumption of innocence,,
 protection against self-incrimination, freedom from ex-post
 facto laws. and double jeopardy, and the right to a speedy
 trial. When a person is physically detained, his initial
 trial must-be- completed within 6 months of arrest. These
 rights are generally observed.
 The Chief Justice and the other Justices of the Supreme Court
 are appointed by the President with the consent of the
 National Assembly. Lower cofrt justices are appointed by the
 Chief Justice with the consent of the other Justices.
 Trials are open to the public, but attendance is sometimes
 restricted. A large number of police are present at some
 trials; courtroom audiendes sometimes create disturbances and
 disrupt the<'proceedings. Judges gCberally allow considerable
 scope for examination of witnesses by both the prosecution and
 defense counsel. The right to-an attorney is respected in
 political cases once the initial investigation is completed.
 Political'and criminal cases are tried by the same court ;
 military courts do not try civilians. Defendants have the
 right of appeal, and appeals-ean~xesult in reduced sentences.
 Death sentences are automatically appealed.
 Historically the executive branch exercised great influence on
 judicial decisions- However, there were some indications of
 increasedudio:al independence in 1989. In a number of cases
 the Constitutional Court, which began operations in September
 1988, found that the Government had violated the
 constitutional rights of individuals. -The Supreme Court
 invalidated the results of elections for two National Assembly
 seats 'due to election law violations by the victorious ruling
 party candidates. Meanwhile, lower courts convicted two
 brothers of former President Chun Doo Hwan and one of Chun's
 closest aides on corruption charges and sentenced them to
 prison.. i'A Seoul court also acquitted a government official of
 bribery charges when the judge. determined that prosecution
 investigators had beaten him in order to extract a 'confession.
 However, criticism that the judiciary is still subject to
 political influence in politically sensitive cases remains.
 Human rights sources put the number of "political" prisoners
 at around 800 at the end of 1989. This figure includes
 persons who committed acts of violence such as firebomb
 
 
 890
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 attacks on government facilities. In some cases, it appears
 that the National Security Law was used to restrict the
 exercise of the basic rights of free speech and assembly.
 According to the Justice Ministry, 695 people were actually
 imprisoned for "security-related offenses" during the first 8
 months of 1989. As of mid-September, 219 were already tried
 and convicted while the rest still awaited trial.
 It is difficult to estimate accurately the number of political
 prisoners since many people are detained and then released
 without charges or charged and then released without being
 tried. It is particularly difficult to determine if someone
 is a political prisoner in cases involving the Law on Assembly
 and Demonstrations and the Labor Laws. In November the
 Government announced that 646 people were in custody for
 "National Security" reasons, including 342 charged under the
 National Security Law, 226 charged under the Law on Assembly
 and Demonstrations, and 91 charged under various laws for
 their participation in labor disputes. Without specific
 information on each case, it is impossible to tell if someone
 was arrested for exercising the right of free association or
 for violent acts during demonstrations. However, it is
 estimated that as of August 1989, the number of political
 prisoners by international human rights standards is in the
 low hundreds. This figure was not substantially changed by a
 Christmas amnesty under which 27 people whom the Government
 described as "radical leftists" were released from prison.
 The Government asserts there are no political prisoners.
 The most highly publicized National Security Law cases of 1989
 involved unauthorized travel to North Korea. The Government
 maintains that it must control all contact with North Korea,
 which it defines in the National Security Law as an "antistate
 organization." The Government approved the February visit to
 North Korea of the honorary chairman of Hyundai, a large
 industrial organization. However, subsequent visits by
 dissident pastor Moon Ik Hwan, student activist Im Su Kyong,
 and Catholic priest Mun Kyu Hyun were not authorized and the
 three were arrested under the National Security Law upon their
 return. The three were charged with visiting the North
 without authorization, making statements praising North Korea,
 and "supporting the northern line." In early October, Rev.
 Moon Ik Hwan was convicted and sentenced to 10 years
 imprisonment. Both the prosecution and the defense are
 appealing this decision.
 The Government also charged former opposition National
 Assemblyman Suh Kyung Won with espionage after it was learned
 in June that he had visited North Korea without government
 permission. Suh admitted going to North Korea, but denied
 that he had spied for the North. In December a Seoul court
 rejected Sub's contention that he was forced to sign a false
 confession and convicted him of espionage. Suh was sentenced
 to 15 years in jail.
 In addition, a number of people--including Kim Dae Jung, the
 leader of Korea's largest opposition party--were charged under
 the National Security Law for knowing about these unauthorized
 trips and failing to inform the authorities. No further legal
 action was taken against Kim Dae Jung. However, nine people
 tried on this charge in connection with the Sub case were
 convicted and given suspended sentences.
 
 
 891
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In general, the Government honors-the right of personal
 privacy and the integrity of the home and family. However,
 many political and religious figures are still subjected to
 varying degrees of government surveillance. Opposition
 assemblymen have charged in the National Assembly that
 telephone tapping and the opening or interception of
 correspondence are prevalent. In August the chief of the
 Korean National-Police (KNP) told the National Assembly that
 of some 53,116 people convicted of violating the National
 Security Law, some 10,000 are still under surveillance. In
 late July, police and agents of the NSP broke into the
 campaign headquarters of a dissident candidate running in a
 National Assembly by-election... The agents reportedly stole a
 document on campaign strategy.
 Listening to North Korean radio is illegal if the authorities
 judge it is for the purpose of "benefiting the antistate
 organization" (i.e., North Korea). Reading or purveying books
 or other, literature considered to be subversive, pro-Communist
 or pro-North Korean is also illegal. Beginning with Moon Ik
 Hwan's visit to North Korea in early 1989, an increasing
 number of people were -arrested for these kinds of offenses.
 The security presence in city centers, near university
 campuses, government buldings, rulingpartyoffices, and media
 outlets is heavy. Citizens, -particularly students and young
 people,.are sometimes stopped, questionedf and searched.
 Government informants are known to be posted on and around
 university campuses.
 Parental rights to educate children are broad. Persons
 thought to have politically suspect backgrounds, however, are
 still denied some forms of employment and advancement,
 particularly in government, the broadcast media; and
 education. Many human rights activists say that big
 corporations still retain an informal system of blicklisting
 "undesirables.",                     -.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government continues to apply the National Security Law
 against piblishers, printers,-anddistributors who produce or
 sell Zsubversive, ideological"-literature.: Restrictions on
 theL-expression of ideas whichthe Government considers
 Communist or pro-North Korean remain severe, despite
 -provisions in the Constitution guaranteeing freedom of
 speech. The-Seoul district court in late September ruled-in a
 civil case that the Culture and Information Ministry's policy
 of banning "antistate" and "antisociety" books was illegal.
 However, this did not prevent -the Government.7from publishing
 an updated-list of Panned books in late November.
 Overall, the expression of opposition views is far less
 restricted than under previous administrations, and debate is
 allowed on previously taboo subjects, such as criticism of the
 President and his family. The Government has allowed an
 increase in media coverage of North Korea, within its
 guidelines,-producing a reaction by rightwing factions which
 hope to counter such leftist journalism with new publications
 of their own. The Government has also allowed somewhat wider
 
 
 892
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 public access to selected North Korean publications. Many
 newspapers and magazines, mostly leftwing and sharply critical
 of the Government, appeared in Korea after the 1987 press law
 took effect.
 Although direct government control over the print media has
 virtually disappeared, some institutions such as the Defense
 Security Command, the NSP, and other government organizations
 with responsibility for North Korean or Communist affairs
 remain basically inaccessible to journalists.
 The Government arrested editorial writer Lee Young Hee of the
 newspaper Hankyoreh Shinmun for planning unauthorized coverage
 of North Korea. Some see Lee's arrest as an effort to still
 his editorial voice, though there has been no censorship of
 the paper's scathing criticism of the Government. Lee was
 convicted and given a suspended sentence. Also, a Hankyoreh
 Shinmun reporter was charged with failing to report to
 authorities an interview with Assemblyman Suh Kyung Won
 concerning Suh's unauthorized trip to North Korea.
 The move to unionize newspapers throughout the country, begun
 in 1988, continued to be a major source of conflict in Korean
 newspaper and broadcasting organizations. All major
 newspapers and broadcasting corporations in Seoul now have
 labor unions.
 Despite indirect government ownership of the two Korean
 television networks, the electronic media moved toward a
 relatively neutral political stance while still remaining less
 independent than the print media. Behind this trend, in part,
 lies the increasing importance of labor unions in the
 broadcasting industry.
 The Government continues to limit academic freedom, both
 directly and indirectly. Professors and university
 administrators are expected to play an active role in
 preventing campus demonstrations, a task many find
 objectionable. There is rising sentiment for greater
 university autonomy. There is also a threat to academic
 freedom from radical leftist students who physically attack
 the person or property of professors whose lectures or
 writings contradict the students' ideology.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Most peaceful, nonpolitical assemblies take place entirely
 without official supervision or restriction. However, the Law
 on Assembly and Demonstrations prohibits assemblies considered
 likely to "undermine" public order, and requires that
 demonstrations of all types, including political rallies, be
 reported in advance to the police. Violation of the law
 carries a maximum sentence of 7 years' imprisonment or a
 fine.
 The Government continues to block many gatherings organized by
 dissidents and particularly students, arguing that they might
 incite "social unrest" and are therefore illegal. Police
 usually try to prevent student demonstrations from moving off
 campuses, and confrontations frequently ensue. These clashes
 often involve violence on both sides.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 
 
 '893
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is'no state religion in Korea. Full freedom prevails
 for proselyti~ing, doctrinal teaching, and conversion. Korea
 both sends did receives missionaries of various faiths, and
 many.religious groups in Korea maintain active links with
 members of similar faiths in other countries. .Th1 Government
 and the public do not discriminate against minorit- sects.
 Adherence to a particular faith confers neither advantages nor
 disadvantages in civil, military, or official life.
 Churches and religious groups are subject to most of the
 restrictions on political activities that apply to other
 institutions. Many of the most vocal and well-organized
 critics of the Government are religious in nature; these
 include Catholic; Prqtestant, and Buddhist groups. Church
 buildings and grounds are sQmetimes used as a refuge by
 leftwing rioters during clashes with police. While the police
 generally respect the principle of sahctuary, they entered the
 grounds of the Catholic cathedrals in Seoul and Chonju in
 1989. Occasionally, police have entered church buildings in
 order to c6nfront students, dissidents, or trade unionists.
 d. Freedom of Movement Withii the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigratidn, and Repatriation
 There is universal freedom of movement and freedom to change
 employment within-the country. On January 1, 'the Government
 dropped all '61e limitati6ns on foreign Eravel  Previously
 these restrictions had prevented most young and middle-aged
 people fr6m going overseas. Travel to North Korea is allowed
 only with Government approval. Political opponents are
 sometimes banned from overseas travel even if they are not
 being sought by the authorities for the commission of a
 crime. For the first 8 months of 1989, the Government
 announced that 1,955 people were forbidden to go overseas.
 This figure includes those involved in criminal offenses,
 government and business figures under investigation in
 connection with Fifth Republic corruption, dissidents and
 student activists. 'Some students were barred from going
 abroad in late June to'prevent their participation in
 Pyongyang's W6rld Youth Festival. Other students were
 prohibited from foreign travel because they'were suspected of
 organizing antidogernment demonstrations, trying to contact
 North Koreans, or attempting travel to North Korea.
 A small number of Indochinese refugees sought first asylum in
 Korea in i989. In midyear the Korean Government adopted a
 policy of refusing landing to boats of Ind6chinese asylum
 seekers. A group of 78 Vietnamese boat people set fire to
 their boat in June to avoid being driven back out to sea by
 the maritime police; they were eventually taken to the Korean
 resettlement camp in Pusan. In late August, a boat carrying
 about 190 Vietnamese boat people was not allowed to land.
 Korean authorities did not admit that they denied landing.
 Section I' Respect-for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Korean people have the right to freely and fairly choose
 their own government. In 1987 they chose their President in a
 free and fairly contested election. In 1988 legislative
 elections, they chose a majority of opposition party members
 to the National Assembly.
 
 
 894
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The Constitution, as amended in 1987, provides for the direct
 election of the President and for a mixed system of direct and
 proportional election of legislators. The President serves a
 single 5-year term and cannot be reelected. The Assembly's
 term is 4 years. The new Constitution strips the President of
 his power to dissolve the Assembly. There is universal
 suffrage for all citizens age 20 or above, and elections are
 held by secret ballot.
 Political power has traditionally been centered in the person
 of the president, strongly supported by the military and
 security agencies. The situation began to change, however,
 when the three opposition parties won a majority in the
 National Assembly in the April 1988 general election.
 There is as yet no local autonomy in Korea, although the
 Assembly passed a law in December calling for local council
 elections in 1990 and local chief executive elections in
 1991. The President and the members of the Assembly are the
 only elected officials in the country.
 The National Assembly in 1989 continued its more independent
 role. In addition to abolishing the Social Safety Act and
 amending the Act for the Protection of Society, the Assembly
 also amended the Law on Assembly and Demonstrations. Because
 of the Assembly's more independent role, the President used
 his veto power on a number of occasions during the year.
 Nonetheless, the Assembly has been marked by differences of
 opinion, not only between the ruling and opposition camps, but
 also among the opposition parties themselves. These
 differences have prevented the Assembly from amending other
 laws remaining from former President Chun Doo Hwan's Fifth
 Republic which many Koreans consider to be undemocratic.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 While the Republic of Korea does not welcome outside
 involvement with respect to human rights, government and
 ruling party officials have generally been willing to meet
 with international human rights groups, including a group from
 the Robert F. Kennedy Foundation that visited Korea in
 November. That group was confronted with protesters during
 its stay in Seoul, but the Government denied any involvement.
 In addition, foreign human rights groups have been allowed to
 observe elections, and the Government has regularly discussed
 human rights with foreign diplomats. In the case of student
 activist Lee Chol Kyu's death, the Government refused to allow
 an American doctor to perform a second autopsy as requested by
 the student's parents.
 According to the Government, public prosecutors and the human
 rights division of the Ministry of Justice are responsible for
 protecting human rights and investigating violations. The
 Government points to President Roh's June 29, 1987 pledge of
 democratization and the developments that followed as proof of
 the current Government's full commitment to democratization
 and the safeguarding of basic human rights.
 The Government justifies its broad security laws and the
 resulting restrictions by arguing that Korea is in a special
 situation. The Korean war ended with the signing of an
 armistice, not a peace treaty, and North Korea remains a
 formidable threat. The Government asserts that unauthorized
 
 
 895
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 attempts to contact North Korea threaten the Government's
 efforts to ensure peaceful reunification on the basis of
 democracy and respect for human rights.
 The National Assembly and the major political parties all have
 committee's concerded with various aspects of human rights. In
 addition, several nonaffiliated private organizationsare
 active in promoting human rights. Chief among these groups
 are the Lawyers Group for - Democratic Bociety, the Human

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Lahguage, or Social Status
 The Republic of Korea is a densely populated and racially
 homogeneous 'country. There are no ethnic minorities of
 significant size. Nonetheless, regional rivalries exist in
 Korea. Many Korafsnbelieve that persons from the
 southwestern region (North-and South Cholla pxovinces) have
 traditionally faced discrimination and that successive
 governments led pr~dominantly:y figures from the southeastern
 region (Northand �outh-Kyongsangpzrovinces) have neglected
 the economid'development of-the Cholla. provinces.
 Korea ls conservative Onfucxian  adition has left women
 subordinate, to men sodially,-Pcpnomically, and legally.''Some
 progress has be'en-made sinceatho founding of the Republic:
 'women can vote, become government officials, and hold elected
 -office.- W61men enjoy full a6&ess to edacational opportunities.
 The National Assembly enacted an Equal Employment Opportunity
 Law in Y98,iwhich condemns sexual disciilnination in hiring-,
 and wages and calls for improved work conditions for-women
 (for example, no night work and-limits on overtime), However,
 it- contains no enforc6ment ,provisions and has had only limited
 practical elfect so far.,'
 Despite a xonstitLltional guarantee of equal rights for men and
 women, traditional social customs are still reflected in the
 -law, par-bicularly An family law. Some forms of discrimination
 still -remain in family, law and women's rights groups actively
 campaign for changes. For example, the father has final
 parental rights over thb children in divoice cases.' In
 December the National Assembly passed a revised family law
 which for the first time makes it possible for a woman to head
 a household and to inherit property upon the death of her
 husband.  (Women can-nhold property in their own names.) The
 new law increases the wife's share-of-the estate to 50 percent
 -uponher husband's;death and divides the remainder equally
 amongmale and female children. The revised law also
 .abolishescthe'h0ouehold head's right to designate where the
 members will live, abolishes the requirement that a married
 -couple move to the husband's place of residence, and expands
 the legally recognized family relationship to include the
 wife's relatives.
 -Korea experienced a jump in traditionally low rates of violent
 crime in 1989. Although violent crimes are directed against
 women, reliable data on-their prevalence are not available. A
 number of cases have surfaced involving women being kidnaped
 
 
 896
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 and sold into prostitution. Wife beatings and other abuses of
 women are known to be a problem, but no reliable data on their
 extent are available. The Government has made crimes against
 women one of its top priorities in its law and order campaign
 and arrested and prosecuted suspects in several cases.
 However, a number of female kidnap victims have complained
 that the police were unhelpful or unsympathetic to their
 attempts to escape from their abductors.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution gives workers the right to free association.
 When a new union is formed, it must notify the Government.
 New unions continued to register in large numbers during
 1989. As of February 1989, some 1.7 million workers, or 22
 percent of the civilian work force, was unionized. Only one
 union is permitted at each place of work, and there is no
 minimum number of members required to form a union. Companies
 have taken advantage of this provision of the law to form
 small, company-controlled unions, which labor organizers have
 often found difficult to replace with more representative
 unions.
 The majority of Korean trade unions are affiliated with the
 Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU). The FKTU is
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. Most of its constituent unions maintain affiliations
 with international trade secretariats. Some 15 percent of
 unionized labor belongs to so-called "democratic unions,"
 which are not affiliated with the FKTU. These unions are
 grouped into regional councils, but have no national
 organization.   However, plans are underway for a new national
 organization called the National Council of Labor Unions. (In
 fact, the law prohibits the formation of a second national
 union structure.) The non-FKTU unions are not affiliated with
 international labor groups.
 In the spring of 1989, the National Assembly passed several
 amendments to the Trade Union Law, which would have lifted the
 ban on union involvement in electoral politics and legalized
 some public sector unions. However, President Roh vetoed the
 bill. The President also vetoed amendments to the Labor
 Dispute Adjustment Act which would have modified the
 prohibition against third-parties--except for the Government
 and the FKTU--intervening in labor disputes. So far the
 Government and National Assembly have had little success
 agreeing on reforms that would improve the legal framework for
 labor-management relations, which basically remains unchanged
 from the Fifth Republic.
 Korea is not a member of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO), but has sent observer delegations to the ILO annual
 conferences since 1982. Korea is interested in joining the
 ILO. In preparation for eventual membership, the Ministry of
 Labor has prepared an analysis of how well Korea's labor laws
 comply with ILO standards as well as proposals for closing
 most of the remaining gaps.
 Strikes are prohibited in government agencies, state-run
 enterprises, and defense industries. Laws requiring that
 enterprises in public interest sectors such as public
 transportation, utilities, public health, banking,
 broadcasting, and communications submit to government-ordered
 
 
 897
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 arbitration restrict the ability of workers in these
 industries to strike. The Labor Dispute Adjustment Law
 requires that unions notify the Ministry of Labor of an
 intention to strike and mandates a-10-day "cooling-off period"
 before a strike can actually begin. (The cooling-off period
 is 15 days in public interest sectors.)
 The Government began to take a more active role in
 labor-management disputes in 1989. Riot police broke up a
 number of illegal strikes, including those by Seoul subway
 workers, workers at Poongsan Metal (a major ammunition
 manufacturer), and a-protracted strike at the Hyundai
 shipyards. The Government has also taken a hard line against
 attempts to form a teachers* union. Such a union is illegal
 under c~irrent law. As of early September, over 1,300
 unionized teachers had been fired and more than 40 arrested.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution and the Trade Union-Law guarantees the
 autonomous right of workers to enjoy freedom of association,
 collective bargaining, and collective action. Extensive
 collective bargaining is practiced. Korea's labor laws do not
 extend the right to bargain collectively to government
 employees, including mployees of state or public-run
 enterprises and defense industries. A 1985 law provides that
 workers in Export Processing Zones (EPZ's) are to receive the
 same right to bargain collectively as other workers. In
 practice, equal treatment in the two existing EPZ's began only
 in the summer of 1987. But in response to a law suit filed by
 a Japanese company operating in the Masan EPZ, the Ministry of
 Labor concluded in August that a 1970 law required the
 Government to treat companies operating in the EPZ's as
 public-interest enterprises. This designation will make it
 difficult for unions at EPZ companies to strike legally,
 becausein cases of labor-management disputes in public sector
 enterprises, the partiescan be required by the Government to
 accept mandatory arbitration. While arbitrati6n decisions can
 be appealed in the courts, such disputes tend to be prolonged.
 As part of its more active labor policy, the Government-has
 also begun an extensive public relations campaign to convince
 workers that-wage increases must be matched-by similar "
 increases in productivity.' The effort is intended to hold
 wage increases in 1990rto-under 10 percent.
 There is no independent system of labor courts. The central
 and local labor committees form'a semiautonomous agency of the
 Ministry of Labor that adjudicates disputes in accordance with
 the Labor Dispute Adjustment Law. Each labor committee is
 composed of equal representation from labor, management, and
 "the public interest." The. local labor committees are
 empowered to decide on remedial measures in cases involving
 unfair labor practices and to mediate and arbitrate labor
 disputes.
 Many major employers are strongly antiunion. In a number of
 cases, "save the company squads" have been hired to beat up
 union organizers and to intimidate workers. The authorities
 have not been effective in investigating such incidents. In
 one case, an employee of a striking Seoul taxi company was
 killed by fellow employees. The union claimed the
 assailants--who were arrested--were part of a "save the
 company squad." The authorities claimed otherwise, describing
 them as "anti-union workers." As in the past, there have been
 
 
 898
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 cases of violence against property by workers, often causing
 extensive damage. There have also been cases in which workers
 have held company executives against their will for brief
 periods of time.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution provides that no person shall be punished,
 placed under preventive restrictions, or subjected to
 involuntary labor except as provided by law and through lawful
 procedures  (Art. 12, Sec. 1). Forced or compulsory labor is
 not condoned by the Government. The Government has
 investigated a number of incidents in which private persons
 sold women into prostitution and forced men to work
 involuntarily on fishing boats. The Government has also
 investigated a number of charges by workers that employers
 were demandiig compulsory labor in the form of overtime work
 beyond the legal maximum.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Korean Labor Standards Law prohibits the employment of
 persons under the age of 13 without a special employment
 certificate from the Ministry of Labor. However, because
 there is compulsory education until the age of 13, few special
 employment certificates are issued for full-time employment.
 Some children are allowed to do part-time jobs such as selling
 newspapers. In order to gain employment, children under 18
 must have written approval from their parents or guardian.
 Employers may require minors to work only a reduced number of
 overtime hours and are prohibited from employing them at night
 without special permission from the Ministry of Labor.
 Nevertheless, employers often treat employees under 18 as
 "regular" workers and do not accord them the legal protections
 to which they are entitled. A large proportion of production
 line workers in labor-intensive industries such as textiles,
 apparel, footwear and electronics are girls in their
 midteens. These girls often work in small, cramped, and
 sometimes dangerous workplaces.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Korea implemented a minimum wage law in 1988. The minimum
 wage level is reviewed annually and in 1989 was set at the
 equivalent of $215 per month. The law does not apply to all
 places of business. Small companies and companies in the
 service sector are exempt. Some exempted companies,
 particularly small ones, still pay below-minimum wages.
 The FKTU continues to claim that the current minimum wage does
 not meet the minimum requirements of urban workers. According
 to government statistics, the money an average Korean
 blue-collar worker takes home in overtime and bonuses
 significantly raises the total compensation package. The
 National Bureau of Statistics announced that in the first
 quarter of 1989 the average monthly salary for an urban head
 of household was $891 (at won 671 per dollar), up 21.2 percent
 over the same period in 1988. According to the Bureau of
 Statistics, the average monthly income of an urban household
 was $1,110, up 21.5 percent (in won terms) from the first
 quarter 1988 figure. Pockets of urban poverty remain, but
 abject poverty has largely been eliminated. According to the
 Government's Economic Planning Board, 5.5 percent of the
 population lived below the poverty level in 1987.
 
 
 899
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The Labor Standards and Industrial Safety and Health Law
 provide for a, maximum 60-hour workweek. Amendments to the
 Labor Standards Law passed in March 1989 will bring the
 maximum regular workweek (excluding overtime) down from 48
 hours to 46 and then to 44 hours over the next 2 years.
 According to the Government, the average Korean worker works
 51.3 hours each week.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, but the
 Ministry of Labor employs few inspectors, and the standards
 are not effectively enforced..
