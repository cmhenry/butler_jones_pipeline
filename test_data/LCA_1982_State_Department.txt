 ST. LUCIA
 St. Lucia, which has a population of 118,000, gained its
 independence from the United Kingdom in 1979. The
 Constitution, which is modeled after the Westminster
 parliamentary system, includes specific safeguards for the
 preservation of human rights. Democratic values and respect
 for individual freedoms are strongly rooted in
 St. Lucian society.
 The country's first two years as an independent nation were
 marked by political disruptions and economic decline. Popular
 discontent finally culminated in massive protest action in
 January 1982 by private sector organizations, unions, and
 citizens' groups forcing the resignation of the Government. In
 the May 1982 elections, a new Government with a strong
 parliamentary majority was elected. Throughout this period of
 political crisis, constitutional processes prevailed, however,
 and only minor incidents of violence occurred.
 Prior to independence, the country had benefitted from
 excellent domestic economic management and had been a model for
 other East Caribbean less developed countries . Especially
 noteworthy were diversification efforts; starting from an
 agricultural base, the country pushed into tourism,
 manufacturing, and related construction activity, becoming the
 most diversified of all the Eastern Caribbean least developed
 countries. During this period, the country relied almost
 exclusively on the private sector as the engine of growth.
 The political uncertainties in combination with labor
 difficulties and the OPEC oil price rises precipitated a
 gradual decline in the economy in 1979, and the downturn was
 further intensified by Hurricane Allen in 1980, which caused
 extensive damage to the country's main export crop, bananas.
 By early 1982 public finances had reached a critical state and
 private sector activity was at a virtual standstill.
 Economic prospects for St. Lucia (1980 per capita GNP was
 $854.00) have improved significantly in 1982 because of the
 enhanced ability to govern of the new moderate gcvernment which
 has a strong 14-3 parliamentary majority.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There were no reports in 1982 of killings for political
 motives.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported in 1982.
 c. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading punishment.
 There have been no allegations of such treatment.
 
 
 621 �
 
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is constitutionally
 prohibited, and this prohibition is respected in practice. The
 Constitution contains a provision for preventive detention when
 a state of emergency is declared, which has not occurred since
 independence.
 f. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 A fair hearing for all defendents by an independent and
 impartial court is required by the Constitution. Accused
 persons are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. The
 Constitution also guarantees the provision of legal counsel.
 There have been no allegations of denial of these rights. The
 country's appeals court is the regional West Indies Court of
 Appeal, which has a widespread reputation for impartiality.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary search and entry are prohibited by the Constitution,
 and this prohibition is respected in practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The St. Lucian Constitution guarantees these freedoms, and they
 are respected in practice. St. Lucia has three political
 party-supported newspapers which represent various shades of
 opinion.   There are privately-owned radio and television
 stations and the government-owned Radio St. Lucia. There is no
 censorship of the media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on public meetings, and opposition
 groups are free to organize. Trade unions are free to organize
 and elect their own leaders without government interference.
 Unions in the private sector of the economy have the right to
 strike. The Government certification process is impartial and
 available to all unions. The Government has initiated the
 creation of a permanent tripartite consultative committee with
 union, private sector, and government representatives to help
 formulate a broadly acceptable formula for economic recovery.
 Labor unions boast fairly sizeable memberships and represent a
 significant forum in the domestic political arena. Their
 international contacts are largely limited to unions within the
 Eastern Caribbean region.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no religious discrimination in St. Lucia, where the
 majority of the population is Roman Catholic. The Church
 stands in high popular esteem. It played an important role as
 mediator among the three principal political parties during the
 January 1982 political crisis.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed in the Constitution and are honored
 in practice. There have been no cases of refugee resettlement
 in St. Lucia.
 
 
 622
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 St. Lucia is a parliamentary, constitutional democracy. Its
 political system continues to be vigorous, with opposition
 parties playing an active role in and out of Parliament. There
 are no restrictions on the participation of women in
 government. They hold prominent positions in the St. Lucia
 civil service, and a woman is presently serving as the Minister
 of Education.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 There have been no reports on St. Lucia by international human
 rights bodies or any requests for investigation. St. Lucia has
 not signed the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights. The
 major domestic organization that follows human rights
 developments is the multi-denominational St. Lucia Christian
 Council. Freedom House's 1982 report classified St. Lucia as
 'free.'
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 St. Lucia has a mixed economy. Foreign investment is
 encouraged, particularly in labor-intensive industries. The
 Government has made strenuous efforts, within the limits of
 severe fiscal constraints, to meet the social and economic
 needs of the population. Hurricane Allen, in August 1980,
 dealt a sharp blow to the agriculture-based economy, throwing
 thousands of banana workers out of their jobs and deroofing
 houses, schools, and hospitals around the island. The
 Government has made efforts to restore housing and public
 buildings. Living conditions for the average citizen are
 gradually returning to the pre-hurricane level. Agricultural
 production has not been fully restored, although the banana
 industry has experienced a remarkable recovery.
 Over the past five years, St Lucia has channeled more than 20
 percent of its total recurrent expenditures into education and
 health, reflecting the high priority given to those areas. In
 1980, for the first time, patient care at the general hospital
 was made free of charge. Elementary school enrollment includes
 95 percent of those eligible; however, shortages of teachers
 and classroom space severely limit secondary school
 enrollment. About one-third of primary school graduates enter
 junior secondary school (at age 12), and one-third of those
 enter senior secondary school (at age 15). Approximately three
 percent of the school population eventually graduate to become
 potential university entrants. The Government is making
 strenuous efforts to expand secondary education, but there is
 little likelihood of major changes in those statistics in the
 near future.
 In agriculture, the Government is studying the antiquated land
 tenure system but has not yet acted on recommendations of its
 land reform commission. Meanwhile, the Government has arranged
 a pilot land resettlement scheme to provide five to ten-acre
 plots for 175 farmers.
 The infant mortality rate is 33 per one thousand live births
 and the population growth rate is 1.5 percent. Life expectancy
 is approximately 68 years. 12 percent of the population has
 access to safe water. The literacy rate is estimated to be
 over 80 percent. Education is compulsory between the ages of 5
 and 15.
 
 
 623
 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 The nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines has a
 Westminster-style parliamentary system of government. It
 became independent from the United Kingdom in 1979 and has had
 long years of experience with British common law which created
 a respect for the rights of the individual and an open
 political system. The 1979 Constitution contains specific
 safeguards for basic human rights. These safeguards are
 reflected in practice.
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines held its first election as an
 independent nation shortly after independence. Four political
 parties of widely-varied ideological views participated; the
 election was judged to be fair. During 1982, the Government
 imposed a controversial three-percent turnover tax on business
 transactions. Merchant organizations opposed to the tax staged
 public protests against it and closed their shops periodically
 to demonstrate their displeasure. The rights of Vincentians to
 assemble and speak out against government policies were
 respected throughout these protest activities.
 St. Vincent's economy grew by nine percent in real terms in
 1981 making it one of the stronger performers in the eastern
 Caribbean despite an unemployment rate estimated between 20 to
 40 percent. With about 50 percent of the population under the
 age of 15, unemployment will continue to be a major problem.
 But economically the short-term outlook is bright. The
 agricultural sector which is the primary money earner is doing
 well, off-shore manufacturing plants continue to expand, and
 the Grenadine Islands are recognized to have considerable
 untapped tourist potential.
 Trends in St. Vincent and the Grenadines indicate a continuing
 respect for human rights. Freedom House, in its 1982 report,
 classified the country as "free."
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There were no reports of killing for political motives in 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1982.
 c. Torture
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and there were no reports
 in 1982 that it was practiced.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. There have been no significant
 complaints about prison conditions. There is one men's prison
 in the country, located in an old building. This facility is
 spartan, but offers basic facilities, is uncrowded, and is well
 maintained. A women's facility is located at a separate
 
 
 624
 location, and conditions are of a similar nature. Police
 practices have not attracted critical comment. The St. Vincent
 and the Grenadines' police is a nonpolitical organization and
 the Government strives to ensure that standards of impartiality
 are maintained and honored in practice.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Constitution provides for preventive detention under
 emergency laws, for legal representation for the detainee, and
 for periodic review of a case. There are no political
 prisoners.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees a fair hearing within a reasonable
 time by an independent and impartial court established by law.
 Access to legal counsel is also guaranteed, and defendants are
 presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. Decisions of
 local courts may be appealed to the Regional West Indies Court
 of Appeal (which has a well-established reputation for
 impartiality) and, ultimately, to the British Privy Council.
 These Constitutional guarantees are respected and strictly
 practiced.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution provides for protection from arbitrary search
 and entry. From all reports, this protection is respected, and
 search warrants are required.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees these freedoms, and they are
 respected in practice. There is no censorship or overt
 government interference in the operation of newspapers.
 Independent publishers have alleged, however, that government
 advertising is often given or withheld in reflection of their
 editorial stances. Criticism of the Government is allowed and
 practiced.
 b. Freedom of Religion
 There is no religious discrimination in St. Vincent and the
 Grenadines. All religions are free to practice and proselytize.
 c. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These rights are provided for by the Constitution and are
 permitted without governmental intervention. Opposition
 factions have in the past, however, accused the Government of
 denying necessary permits for political reasons. Mass public
 meetings opposing government policy have been allowed in 1982.
 The Government has accepted the International Labor
 Organization's convention on freedom of association. Unions
 enjoy the right of collective bargaining and are generally
 active on the industrial relations scene. Labor unions
 represent approximately 7,000 workers, or somewhat over 10% of
 the labor force. There is no discrimination favoring one union
 or another.
 
 
 625
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the
 country as well as the right to enter and leave freely. That
 freedom is honored in practice. No one is known to have
 applied for refugee status in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a parliamentary,
 constitutional democracy. It has universal suffrage, and there
 is active political participation in national elections every
 five years. Few organized political groups are active during
 inter-election periods. Rather, there are small political
 parties that appear to function actively only during election
 time.
 While there are no legal impediments to women participating in
 the political process, they have traditionally not played a
 prominent role for cultural reasons. Those who have done so
 have generally been wives of prominent politicians. No women
 were elected to Parliament or to other high elective office at
 the most recent elections.
 3. Government Attitudes Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 As a new nation, St. Vincent and the Grenadines has not yet
 acceded, of its own accord, to any international human rights
 conventions. The Government has announced its intention to
 review individually all treaties to which Great Britain acceded
 on its behalf. There are no branches of international human
 rights organizations in St. Vincent, nor is there any local
 body publicly active in monitoring human rights violations.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines had in 1981 a per capita Gross
 Domestic Product estimated at $660, up from $270 in 1970. As
 this figure suggests, the nation has severe economic problems
 and also suffers from high unemployment, but there are no
 reliable estimates. Considerable agricultural damage was done
 by the eruption of Soufriere Volcano in April 1979. Economic
 progress was set back even more in August 1980 by Hurricane
 Allen, which caused considerable infrastructure damage and
 devastated much of the agricultural economy--especially the
 banana crop. The Government has endeavored to overcome these
 problems and has made good progress.
 While the basis of the economy is agriculture, the Government
 has been attempting to diversify into tourism, but the
 worldwide recession and poor promotional efforts have impeded
 this endeavor. The Government has outlined tax incentives and
 other encouragement to foreign private investment employing
 Vincentian labor. The small number of foreign investors in
 St. Vincent express satisfaction with the Government's
 industrial program which led to the creation of an additional
 thousand jobs between mid-year 1980 and 1981.
 There are no laws specifically guaranteeing women's rights in
 the employment field. The industrial wages act provides for a
 different--and lower--minimum wage for women than for men
 
 
 626
 engaged in factory work. There is also a provision prohibiting
 ,women from employment during midnight shifts--a regulation
 originally designed to benefit female workers.
 The nation's poverty limits the resources it can expend on
 priorities such as social services. Good medical care is not
 available in much of the nation because of a scarcity of
 doctors and their concentration in the capital. The Government
 established a clinic in the heretofore medically-unserviced
 Union Island in the.Grenadines, and US Peace Corps Volunteers,
 including a dentist and a physician, are now working there.
 Poor medical conditions are reflected in a relatively high
 infant mortality rate (56 per 1,000 live births). Education
 and housing-need substantial improvement, a fact which the
 Government acknowledges. Although such indicators as
 percentage of population with access to safe water have shown
 improvement (17 percent in 1970; 25 percent in 1978), primary
 school enrollment has fallen (1970, 97 percent; 1978, 85
 ,percent) as the rate of population growth has risen from 0.7
 percent in 1970 to 2.1 percent in 1978.
 The Government has a National Provident Fund which provides for
 retirement benefits for much of the wage-earning population.
 Currently, a new national insurancV scheme is planned, which
 will not, however, encompass unemployment insurance. There
 are, under present law, no benefits for the jobless. There
 have been unconfirmed charges that the present Government has
 neglected development and social services in the small
 Grenadine islands. Most estimates have placed the Grenadines'
 per capita income at a higher level than that of St. Vincent
 proper, as a result of remittances from the many islanders
 employed as crew by shipping lines.
 
 
 627
 SURINAME
 For the first five years following independence from the
 Netherlands in 1975, Suriname was a functioning democracy
 with an excellent human rights record. Following a coup
 d'etat on February 25, 1980, the Constitution was suspended.
 In April 1982 a decree was issued which is presently in
 effect as a "transitional Constitution" until a new formal
 Constitution, which the Government claims to have in
 preparation, can be promulgated.
 On December 8, 1982, the Surinamese military Government,
 headed by Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse, took a series of repressive
 actions against its civilian opponents, which constituted
 flagrant violations of human and civil rights and which
 represent a serious deterioration of the human rights
 situation in that country. At least 18 people were detained,
 and at least 15 of them were shot and killed while in
 government custody without any semblance of due process.
 There are indications that some were beaten to death or
 tortured.
 Officially the Government justified its actions as a response
 to a purported coup plot by a few members of Suriname's
 "narrow upper class" and stated that the killings occurred
 when the detainees attempted to escape, but the Government
 has provided no evidence to support either charge. Most of
 those killed were prominent civilians, including the leader
 of a major labor confederation, lawyers, journalists, and
 academics, all of whom in recent weeks and months had been
 pressing for the end of military government and the res-
 toration of elections and democratic institutions. It is not
 known if others have been detained since the events of
 December 8 or how many persons may remain in detention.
 Simultaneous with the detentions, the offices of several
 organizations which had been critical of the Government in
 recent weeks were destroyed by fire or bombing, including the
 Moederbond trade union organization, two private radio
 stations, and one private newspaper. While the identity of
 the perpetrators has not been fully established, there are
 indications that the violence was carried out with the
 complicity of the Government.
 On December 9 the military Government imposed conditions
 resembling martial law. The university was closed in-
 definitely, a dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed, all non-government
 owned or controlled media were closed, and gatherings of more
 than four persons prohibited. While it is not yet clear how
 long these conditions will remain in effect, the killings,
 suppression of the press, and other repressive actions
 represent a serious deterioration in the human rights
 situation.
 The United States, the Netherlands, and various international
 organizations such as the European Parliament, the Inter-
 national Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the
 Caribbean Congress of Labor have protested the killings and
 violations of human rights. The United States and the
 Netherlands have announced the suspension of economic and
 military assistance to Suriname.
 
 
 628
 Prior to the events of December 8 there had been human rights
 violations in 1982 in certain areas, although many human
 rights remained protected, reflecting the still unsettled
 political situation since the military coup of February 1980
 by a group of army sergeants.
 The "transitional Constitution" now in effect guarantees
 traditional rights and liberties, but allows for the
 curtailment of these rights at the discretion of the military
 authority during a state of emergency, such as exists at the
 present time. Freedom House, in its 1982 report, classified
 Suriname as "Not Free".
 Suriname's parliament was indefinitely suspended six months
 after the 1980 coup. At present laws take the form of
 decrees issued by a two-man military authority or resolutions
 passed by Suriname's Council of Ministers. Prior to the
 events of December 8, there had been mounting public pressure
 for the establishment of a legislative body, elections, and
 the restoration of democratic institutions, a trend which has
 now been suppressed. The entire cabinet resigned on December
 9, 1982 but the members agreed to remain in an acting status
 until a new government is formed. The activities of
 political parties have been prohibited since mid-1980. On
 December 28, 1982 Col. Bouterse gave a televised interview in
 which he said that parliamentary democracy will "never
 return" to Suriname because as "we in Suriname know" it was
 dysfunctional and led to "chaos" in the country.
 Formal power to govern in Suriname continues to reside in the
 two-man military authority, which has assigned, in turn,
 "supreme administrative authority" to a four-member Policy
 Center. The two members of the military authority serve
 concurrently as Chairman and Vice-chairman of the Policy
 Center. A Council of Ministers headed by a Prime Minister is
 assigned the day-to-day running of the Government but has
 little impact on policies. Even prior to the events of
 December 1982, the assumption of more power by the Policy
 Center, following an attempted coup, accelerated an existing
 trend toward greater concentration of political power in the
 hands of a small group.
 The Government has declared itself to be strongly committed
 to economic justice and equality of opportunity for all
 citizens and has sought to establish what it describes as a
 "new democracy" by introducing non-traditional structures
 such as appointed people's committees, and district and
 regional councils. The Government's avowed aim is to elicit
 greater "participation" by the "masses" in political
 activities and to prevent a return to the pre-1980 situation
 when political parties were divided along ethnic or religious
 lines, and corruption and mismanagement had led to
 near-paralysis in Government. However, the December
 crackdown on labor, the press, and closure of the university
 has demonstrated the Government's intolerance of independent
 civilian organizations and institutions and its willingness
 to take brutal measures against those advocating the
 restoration of genuine participatory democratic
 institutions. In his December 28 interview Col. Bouterse
 said that a revival of independent media would have to await
 establishment of a control system under the new Government
 that will assure that the media are supportive of official
 programs, and that reporting is based on state-supplied
 information, and not on unnamed sources that give a
 detrimental picture of government activities.
 
 
 629
 The Government seeks to legitimize its monopoly of authority
 and power by references to the imperatives of a
 "revolutionary" society. However, the state-directed
 economic practices of so-called Marxist countries have not
 been emulated. Suriname has essentially a free-market
 economy, though restrictions have been put on consumer
 product imports, and there are some foreign exchange
 controls. The Government is currently stressing a campaign
 of assistance to local entrepreneurs to encourage domestic
 production for import substitution.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Prior to the events of December 8, 1982, at which time at
 least 15 people were shot without due process, political
 killings and assassinations had not occurred in Suriname
 during 1982. Earlier in the year, however, the execution of
 one of the leaders of the failed March coup attempt, without
 recourse to normal due process procedures, generated much
 concern. The military, in response to widespread public
 outcry at this action, claimed its right under "state of war"
 to conduct a "field court martial" and pass and carry out any
 sentence including the death penalty.
 b. Disappearance
 Prior to the events of December 1982, there were no reported
 cases of clandestine incarceration or disappearances during
 1982. It is not known how many individuals may still remain
 in government custody following the December 1982 roundup.
 c. Torture
 Under the "transitional Constitution", torture is
 prohibited. There have, however, been allegations of
 physical abuse of prisoners. In its 1982 report, Amnesty
 International cited its concern about allegations that people
 under interrogation had been ill-treated by military police.
 There have been many reports that those killed while in
 government custody in December 1982 had been beaten or
 otherwise tortured.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Even though cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is prohibited under the "transitional
 Constitution", there have been reports of such treatment.
 Prior to the events of December 1982, there had been a
 decline in reports of incidents like those following the 1980
 coup when a number of persons arrested on criminal charges
 were severely beaten. At that time, moderates in Suriname
 persuaded the military authority to return to normal
 practices of civil justice, and they were assisted by the
 furor aroused in Holland when videotapes of a simulated
 beating were shown on Dutch television stations.
 Prior to the events of December 1982, the military authority
 had been anxious to improve its public image, and few cases
 of mistreatment of civilian prisoners had been reported.
 
 
 630
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The "transitional Constitution" guarantees freedom from
 arbitrary arrest and imprisonment. It does not, however,
 provide for habeas corpus or fix a limit on the period of
 investigative detention. According to the Government, the 15
 individuals killed in December 1982 were allegedly detained
 in connection with a purported coup plot but, as far as can
 be determined, they were never formally charged.
 Even prior to the events of December 1982, those suspected of
 "counter-revolutionary" activity were treated more harshly
 than those accused of civil crimes. Approximately 30-40
 counter-revolutionary suspects detained after the March 1982
 coup attempt have been held for long periods without trial or
 hearing. Some are held in overcrowded facilities, and some
 have been beaten. The Government has said protracted
 detention is necessary because such plotters constitute a
 "threat to national security." Also, in an incident at the
 end of October 1982, a prominent labor leader was arrested by
 military police and jailed for several hours without benefit
 of court order. He was accused of insulting the chairman of
 the Policy Center, a government minister, and a visiting head
 of state. He was freed as the result of widespread strikes
 and demonstrations by workers and other citizens in protest
 of the government's action. The same man was among those
 killed while in military custody on December 8/9.
 In August 1982 the military leaders bowed to pressure from
 the judicial system, lawyers, and national organizations, in
 reversing a controversial decision to re-arrest two army
 officers suspected of complicity in the failed March coup,
 who had been freed by the judge advocate until their trial
 could be arranged. The officers were ultimately released by
 the court because of insufficient evidence to link them to
 the coup attempt.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The guhrantee of due process contained in the "transitional
 Constitution" was denied to those shot by the Government in
 December 1982. While the "transitional Constitution" does
 not specifically mention an independent judiciary such as
 existed before the 1980 coup, most civil and criminal cases
 continue to be handled in accordance with pre-1980
 procedures. The special courts established by the present
 Government to try all cases of alleged corruption by the
 former Government continue to be run under traditional rules
 of law. Regular judges oversee the work of the military
 investigators and apply normal rules of procedure and
 evidence during trials. More often than not, fines have been
 reasonable and sentences meted out have equalled the time the
 defendants had already been held, allowing immediate release.
 Cases dealing with coup plots are handled outside the regular
 judicial system, in military courts headed by a civilian
 judge. In the trial of the co-leader and other alleged
 co-conspirators of the March coup attempt, the military court
 postponed trial for a review of the evidence after the
 defense raised several questions of possible conflict of
 interest on the part of several of the military judges.
 Although the co-leader was given a 12-year prison sentence by
 the court, he and lawyers involved with his defense were shot
 while in government custody in December 1982.
 
 
 631
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Under the "transitional Constitution", approval of a "lawful
 authority" is required for entry into the home. Civilian
 police have generally acquired a magistrate's order to enter
 the home since the 1980 coup. Because the state of emergency
 is still in existence, however, the military police are under
 no such restriction. During an October national military
 readiness exercise following the report that dissident
 expatriates in Holland may have hired mercenaries to
 overthrow the Government, there were unconfirmed reports that
 several homes were entered by military police without prior
 court approval. During its December roundup of members of
 its political opposition, the military was unrestrained in
 its violation of domestic privacy. There was no warning to
 victims and, as far as it known, the military made no claim
 that its arrests were sanctioned by law.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the "transitional Constitution" guarantees freedom
 of speech, in the aftermath of the December 8 events all
 non-government-owned or controlled newspapers and radio
 stations were closed. This action, combined with the killing
 of prominent journalists who had been outspoken in their
 criticism of military rule, has effectively suppressed press
 criticism of the Government and represents a major erosion of
 political rights. Before newspapers are allowed to resume
 operations, the Government has stated that an information
 code to regulate dissemination of information will have to be
 adopted. The "transitional Constitution" also guarantees the
 integrity of letter, telephone, and telex facilities.
 However, there are unconfirmed reports that selective
 monitoring and censorship continues. Bouterse has criticized
 foreign media, particularly the Dutch radio and press, for
 showing only the worst side of the revolution and ignoring
 its successes. Bouterse has called the domestic and Dutch
 media "enemies of the people" who were attempting to "weaken"
 the revolution by failing to cover the Government's attempts
 to strengthen the economy. Prior to the closure of all
 non-government owned or controlled newspapers and radio
 stations in December, the military insisted that all reports,
 including broadcast news about internal affairs be approved
 by the National Information Service prior to publication.
 During October 1982 strikes in support of demands for
 restoration of representative democracy, the Government
 instituted a partial blackout of the non-government,
 independent media and also closed two radio stations for
 several hours when they refused to abide by a prohibition
 against broadcasting news reports of strike activity. In two
 incidents earlier in 1982, newspaper editors were called by
 both the National Information Service and the military
 authority and ordered not to print articles dealing with the
 controversial new land law. The Government also cut back its
 advertising in newspapers which ignore the informal
 censorship rules, although this action has been publicly
 explained as due to current budgetary stringencies. In late
 1982, prior to the December events, several newspaper
 articles criticized government policies in sensitive areas,
 such as relations with Cuba and media control policies,
 without suffering overt reprisals by the Government.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed in the "transitional
 Constitution", but the Government continues to prohibit
 political gatherings. This prohibition was expanded on
 December 9 when all public gatherings of more than four
 persons were prohibited. Since then a women's peace march
 protesting government actions was allowed to take place, but
 the Government announced that future violators of the ban
 would be punished, and police have used tear gas to disband
 other small public gatherings.
 Suriname's labor force is large in proportion to total
 population, is highly unionized (60 percent), and has been
 active in pressing for the restoration of democratic
 institutions, particularly during the weeks prior to the
 December events. The labor movement is divided into four
 labor federations. The leader of one of the federations, the
 Moederbond, was among those killed while in government
 custody in December. A leader of several smaller unions was
 also killed. The leader of another labor federation was
 arrested on December 8 but subsequently was released.
 In November 1982 a newly formed Association for Democracy, an
 umbrella organization of 13 traditional business,
 professional, religious, and community organizations, sent an
 open letter to the military Government calling for the
 withdrawal of the army from politics and the establishment of
 constitutional civilian government. Several civilian lawyers
 and businessmen associated with that organization were among
 those killed in December.
 Prior to the events of December 1982, petitions by two of the
 old political parties to gather for the ostensible purpose of
 celebrating the anniversary of their founding were refused,
 but gatherings by labor unions and other groups for
 quasi-political activities had been allowed. Moreover, the
 Moederbond labor federation had filed a grievance with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU)
 alleging government complicity in the break-up of a meeting
 at the union's headquarters by a government-sponsored youth
 group. The Government had said only that it would
 investigate the incident. The ICFTU had written to the
 acting president of the country and filed a grievance with
 the International Labor Organization on the matter. As noted
 above, in early December, Moederbond headquarters was
 destroyed.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion continues to be respected.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Following the events of December 1982, the border was
 temporarily closed but has since been reopened, although the
 Government has stated it would continue to "monitor"
 crossings. Prior to that time, with the exception of a few
 former government officials being investigated for alleged
 involvement in corruption, there had been complete freedom of
 movement within the country and to and from foreign
 countries. Emigration had been unhindered and repatriation
 encouraged.

 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Lt. Col. Bouterse is the dominant figure in the small group
 that dominates the Government of Suriname. Activities of
 political parties have been prohibited since mid-1980. The
 four-man Policy Center rules by decree, and elections have
 not been held. The rulers stress that they fully support
 public participation in the political process as long as it
 is through the new non-traditional institutions they have
 established by decree, such as the "People's Committees," and
 other "mass organizations" comprising groups such as students
 and women. Government officials are also accessible to
 individuals and various interest groups and listen to their
 views on current issues. But the Government is not
 constrained to accept these views, and the only limits on the
 military authority's exercise of power are self-imposed
 rather than institutional. In a speech on November 15 the
 Government stated that outlines of "new democratic
 structures," in accord with "true democracy," would be
 announced by March 1983. Following the events of early
 December, Lt. Col. Bouterse announced that beginning in May
 1983, all sectors of society will be called to discuss
 adoption of a "new type of democracy" and that free elections
 would be held sometime in 1983. Women have traditionally
 been active politically through various civic organizations.
 Women do hold positions in various Government ministries.
 There are currently no women serving in the Cabinet or Policy
 Center.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government of Suriname has rejected criticism and protest
 of the events of December 1982 by various international
 organizations, including the European Parliament, the ICFTU,
 and the Caribbean Congress of Labor, and continues to justify
 its actions as a response to a purported coup attempt and to
 the activities of labor unions, university students, and
 various private media organizations to destabilize the
 Government. The Government also has not responded to a
 specific letter sent by the AFL-CIO protesting the execution
 of workers or to a letter from the ICFTU protesting the
 violation of basic human and trade union rights, both of
 which were sent in December 1982. The Government also has
 not yet responded to a September ICFTU letter to the acting
 President alleging violation of a trade union's right of
 assembly. Amnesty International wrote in its report covering
 1981 that it was concerned over the retroactive character of
 legislative acts and the actions of the special corruption
 courts established after the February 1980 coup. Reportedly,
 Amnesty International wrote to the then Minister of Justice
 regarding the execution of one of the leaders of the failed
 1982 coup attempt and regarding claims of testimony under
 duress by two other persons being held in the same
 connection. Amnesty International has communicated its
 concerns about the December executions to the Secretary
 General of the United Nations and to the Inter-American
 Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American
 States and asked them to intervene and to urge the Surinamese
 Government to prevent further executions.

 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The "transitional Constitution" incorporates the Surinamese
 rulers' stated intention to provide jobs for alle adequate
 salaries, housing, medical treatment, nutrition, and
 education. The Government has increased state control over
 many economic sectors, justified as a means to safeguard the
 public interest, and has also expanded government regulatory
 activities over the still-large private sector.
 In 1981 Suriname's population was estimated at 379,000, but
 as a result of emigration since then, the resident population
 is currently estimated at 353,000. Suriname's population and
 its growth rate of 2.3 percent (1980) do not constitute
 constraints upon its development prospects. However, a
 significant increase in emigration as occurred in 1980 would
 have an adverse impact on availability of skilled manpower.
 Despite recent political and economic problems, social and
 economic standards have remained generally good, as reflected
 in available national statistics. Suriname's per capita GNP
 is $3,042 (1981). While this figure is somewhat high because
 it reflects Dutch economic assistance, the average Surinamer
 is relatively well off. All children between the ages of six
 and 12 are entitled to free public schooling, and adult
 literacy is estimated at 80 per cent (1975). Suriname has an
 extensive system of rural medical clinics to supplement the
 more technically sophisticated urban hospitals, and health
 care is adequate and inexpensive. Life expectancy at birth
 is 68.3, and the infant mortality rate is 6.5 per thousand
 live births. The calorie supply available for consumption is
 118 percent relative to nutritional requirements, and
 malnutrition is not common. Because of the tradition of
 strong family and community ties, the old, infirm, or
 unemployed can turn to relatives and friends for food and
 shelter, and few people live in abject poverty.
 Even prior to the events of early December and the subsequent
 decision of the Netherlands Government to suspend its
 sizeable economic assistance payments, the Surinamese economy
 was entering a difficult period, and the Government had been
 warning the general public and special interest groups to
 lower their expectations. Because of the world recession,
 loss of investor confidence due to current political
 uncertainties, and the delay in promulgating a new investment
 code and development strategy, the economy remains stagnant.
 As in 1981, new investments or expansions of existing plants
 and inventory in 1982 have declined, and many businessmen
 have reported fear of reduced year-end retail profit
 figures. The international market for bauxite and rice, the
 country's two main exports, will not soon stabilize, and the
 declining revenues will exacerbate the economic and political
 stresses in a country accustomed to a relatively high
 standard of living. The suspension of Dutch development
 assistance, which began at independence in 1975 and which
 amounted to almost $100 million per year, will seriously
 reduce funds available for development projects. The
 Government had also planned to use these funds to expand
 social welfare programs in areas of jobs, pensions, medical
 care, and education. In hopes of creating a self-sustaining
 economy, the Government is now shifting emphasis to more
 immediately productive areas, in order to reduce import
 needs, create jobs, and increase tax revenues, as well as
 meet greatly expanded social welfare demands.
