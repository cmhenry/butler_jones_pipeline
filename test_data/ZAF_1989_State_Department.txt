 SOUT AFRIA
 Despite encouraging moves by the South African Government
 since the September elections, the main legislative pillars of
 apartheid remained in place in 1989. South Africa's laws
 codify the doctrine of apartheid, which prescribes the basic
 rights and obligations of people according to their racial or
 ethnic origin. The country's black majority (74.7 percent of
 its population) suffers from pervasive, legally sanctioned
 discrimination based on race in political, economic, and
 social aspects of life. The "colored" (mixed race) and Asian
 minorities (8.7 percent and 2.6 percent of the population,
 respectively) also suffer from extensive racial
 discrimination, although to a somewhat lesser degree than
 South Africa's black population. While the Government claims
 that South Africa is a parliamentary democracy, whites (14
 percent of the population) retain a monopoly of political
 power. Blacks continue to be denied the right to vote in.
 national elections and to be represented in Parliament. A new
 Constitution in 1984 replaced the previously all-white
 Perliament with a tricameral one with separate chambers for
 whites, "coloreds," and Asians. However, whites retain
 parliamentary control over key affairs, and the executive
 branch (headed by a State President with extraordinarily
 strong powers) remains firmly under white control.
 Since 1948 the Afrikaner-dominated National Party, presently
 led by recently elected State President F.W. De Klerk, has
 developed the complex legislation and institutions comprising
 the apartheid system. Central to the policy of separate,
 racially based political institutions was the creation,
 beginning in the 1950's, of 10 "homelands" to which blacks
 were assigned on the basis of ethnic background. These
 homelands comprise only 13 percent of South Africa's area and
 are generally fragmented parcels of land in impoverished rural
 areas. Since 1976 the Government has granted "independence"
 to four homelands, thereby stripping an estimated 8 million
 South African blacks of their South African citizenship.
 South Africa is the only country that has recognized the
 "independence" of these homelands. Outside the homelands, a
 growing black urban population of more than 10 million persons
 lives under apartheid regulations in massive, segregated
 townships on the periphery of large cities.
 In the late 1970's, the South African Government began to
 introduce piecemeal reforms to ameliorate some aspects of
 apartheid without threatening continued white control of the
 nation's key political structures. In 1989 the white
 electorate again returned the National Party to power (albeit
 with a distinctly reduced majority due to whites defecting to
 both the liberal Democratic Party and the Conservative Party)
 on a platform promising limited reform and dialog with the
 extraparliamentary opposition.
 White control of the Government is backed by a powerful
 defense and police establishment, especially the South African
 Defense Force (SADF), with more than 100,000 active duty
 personnel and nearly 400,000 reservists, and the multiracial
 South African Police (SAP), with 56,000 members. The SADF has
 been used to assist the SAP in patrolling the black
 townships. Through most of the year, the security
 establishment, including the military, police, and the
 intelligence services, played a key role in domestic and
 foreign policymaking through the State Security Council (SSC),
 a supracabinet body, which includes a small number of
 
 
 333
 SOUTH AFRICA
 "civilian" ministers and security chiefs. Under the SSC, the
 National Security Management System (NSMS) performed
 administrative functions in the townships through joint
 management centers (JMC's) and undertook extensive
 intelligence operations through a network of informers.
 However, in 1989 State President De Klerk announced a major
 reconstruction of the security system. Under'the new system,
 the JMC's were replaced by bodies which are managed at the
 local level, with ultimate accountability to the Cabinet.
 South African security forces are active in the "independent"
 homelands, and human rights observers believe elements of the
 SAP continue to give at least tacit support to conservative
 black vigilante groups, in both, the homelands.and the
 townships." The Government extended on June'9 the state of
 emergertcy (SOE) for the fourth consecutive year, which greatly
 increases state power in many areas, including detentions.
 South African's'economy features a highly developed industrial
 sector and extensive agricultural and mineral resources. In
 1989 gross domestic product growth fqll below 2 percent.
 Sanctions and lack of c6nfidence in South Africa's situation
 on the.part of foreign investors also restrict the potential
 for economic growth. Since the mid-1970's, black unemployment
 levels have increased significantly, and per capita income
 among blacks has stagnated. Local economists estimate that an
 annual real growth'rate above'5 percent is necessary for the
 economy to absorb the roughly 350,000 black entrants to the
 labor market each year. An even higher rate of growth would
 be necessary to reducepresent black unemployment, which many
 private observers estimate at 25 to 30 percent, and as high as
 50 percent in the homelands. Despite the high level of black
 unemployment, more thaq 211,000 migrant workers from the
 neighboring southern African states were employed in South
 African mines in 1988. Apartheid laws discriminate against
 blacks in housing, employment, and education, serving to
 perpetuate a gross income disparity between whites and blacks.
 While the fundamental, highly restrictive human rights
 situation in South Africa gemained unchanged in 1989,
 government repression of antiapartheid opposition, including
 nonviolent peaceful protest, eased after the September
 election of State President De Klprk. He took a series of
 positive steps which, although not'yet accepting full
 political participation by blacks, included the release of
 seven African National Congress (ANC) senior leaders and one
 Pan African Congress (PAC) leader and movement toward dialog
 with the ANC." In 1989 contact between the exiled ANC and
 internal political pressure groups became increasingly
 common. Unofficial meetings also occurred between the ANC and
 members of the influential Afrikaner Broederbond. Other
 positive steps included the President's announcements that
 beaches were now desegrated and that the Separate Amenities
 Act would be repealed during the 1990 parliamentary session.
 The President's December meeting with Nelson Mandela, the most
 senior imprisoned ANC leader, fueled hopes for Mandela's
 imminent release. Former State President P. W. Botha also met
 with Mandela shortly before stepping down.
 Inkatha, a black organization with 1.7 million members, the
 majority of which are Zulu, has a wide agenda of political,
 social, and economic issues. The Chief Minister of the
 KwaZulu homeland, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, heads the
 organization. In early 1980, relations soured between the ANC
 and Buthelezils movement over strategy and tactics in the
 antiapartheid effort.

 SUTH AFRICA
 Black groups continued to resist apartheid in 1989. At the
 beginning of the year, detainees held under the SOE began a
 series of nationwide hunger strikes against the questionable
 reasons for, and unclear duration of,-their incarceration.
 The Government abandondd initial efforts to break their strike
 and released, with serious restrictions in many cases,
 approximately 800 detainees between February and April,
 according to statistics released by the Minister of Law and
 Order.
 In early August the Mass Democratic Movement (MDM)--a
 coalition made up of leaders from banned antiapartheid
 organizations such as the United Democratic Front (UDF) and
 the largest black trade union, the Congress of South African
 Trade Unions (COSATU), which, like the ANC, subscribe to the
 Freedom Charter--launched a civil disobedience-campaign
 against restrictions, bannings, and-petty apartheid. The
 protests spread throughout South Africa, as individuals and
 organizations defied their restrictions and demonstrated
 against a plethora of other apartheid issues--such as press
 restrictions and the Labor Relations Act. The National Party
 Government, facing a difficult September election, responded
 with increased intimidation and a wave of detentions. Key
 leaders of the peaceful protest movement especially were
 targeted. Political tensions exploded on the eve of the
 September 6 national elections. Police used buckshot and tear
 gas against black and "colored" youths in the Cape Town area.
 Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other church leaders blamed the
 -police for the 23 (some reports claim as many as 25) resulting
 deaths, one of-the highest, unrest-related death tolls in a
 single day in South African history. Police vigorously
 disputed these charges; the new State President called for an
 investigation. One of the first steps of the De Klerk
 administration after September 6 was to allow large-scale
 demonstrations. On September 14, 30,000-35,000 people marched
 to protest apartheid and police brutality in Cape Town, with
 similar rallies occurring later-in other major cities.
 Violence in South Africa is multifaceted--including by black
 against black--although-overall levels- seemed below those-of
 1988. Factional fighting--which cannot be easily explained in
 tribal or urban versus -rural-terms--continued in Natal/KwaZulu
 on an unprecedented scale between Inkatha and UDF/COSATU
 groups, claiming 593 deaths in �he Durban area and 651 in the
 Pietermaritzburg area in 1989.  Violence-in Natal seemed to
 increase as-peace initiatives between the two sides faltered
 in late 1989.
 The spector of vigilante (both white and black) and rightwing
 terrorism grew in 1989, illustrated by the assassination of
 prominent human rights activist David Webster on May 1. An
 extremist white group, calling itself the "Wit Wolwe" (White
 Wolves), claimed responsibility for a spate of attacks on
 antiapartheid targets. The conflict between the Government
 and the ANC, on the other hand, quieted considerably as ANC
 armed attacks inside South Africa diminished markedly.
 The Government has used its emergency powers to arrest more
 than 32,000 people since June 1986. Prior to the
 parliamentary elections on September 6, SOE detentions
 increased sharply-from 24 on August 20 to 234 by September 4,
 and human rights organizations' statistics indicate close to
 1,600 persons were arrested for defiance campaign activity
 between August 1 and September 4.. By the end of the year,
 there were 18 persons detained under the SOE, 24 under the
 
 
 335
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Internal Security Act (ISA), and an estimated 2,000 to 3,000
 serving prison �erms for unrest-related offenses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political violence continued to plague South Africa in 1989.
 Accurate statistics on the number-of deaths related to
 political violence remained difficult to obtain due to
 restrictions on reporting unrest incidents. The Government
 claimed'that the level of unrest continued to decline under
 the SOE. -According to the SAP, there had been over 15,000
 unrest incidents in the year prior to the proclamation of the
 first SOE,-and about 5,000 a year since the SOE'was imposed.
 Incidents-of violence in 1989 remained below 1988 levels.
 Unrest monitoring groups estimated that at least 846 people
 died between June 1987 and June 1988, compared to some 695
 during the same period a year earlier. Statistics compiled
 from various media sources indicate 444 died in unrest-related
 incidents between January and October.
 V
 Political violence was worst in Natal. Factional clashes
 between UDF/COSATU supporters and members of KwaZulu Chief
 Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha movement continued with an
 estimated 1,244 people killed in 1989. Total deaths since
 September 1987 are 2,300 with thousands wounded and thousands
 of homes burned and damaged. The violence abated towards the
 middle of the year, but flared again in late 1989 when peace
 negotiations between the two groups faltered. Tensions in and
 around Durban townships rose to new levels as the internecine
 violence-which engulfed the area in 1988 became entrenched.
 The causes of this violence are many, including the power
 struggle between Inkatha and the UDF/COSATU; desires for
 personal revenge; attempts to save family 5nd possessions from
 harm; frustration over inferior schools and other facilities
 for blacks; and resentment of police, black and white.
 Outside Natal, townships remained mostly quiet relative to the
 1984-86 period, with the notable exception of violence in Cape
 Town on September 6, election eve.
 There was a marked decline during 1989 in bomb attacks
 throughout South Africa. However, mysterious killings,
 attacks, and threats against antiapartheid groups and trade
 unions increased as the spector of vigilante rightwing
 terrorism grew. On May 1, lawyer/researcher and antiapartheid
 activist David Webster was assassinated in Johannesburg. The
 body of the National Council of Trade Unions (NACTU) East Rand
 leader Bafana Sigasa was found floating in a dam after he was
 last seen alive on July 19. In August hand grenades caused
 extensive damage to the home of well-known Soweto poet Mzwakhe
 Mbuli, narrowly-missing his wife and child. In late August,
 persons suspected to be rightwing vigilantes firebombed
 vehicles and shot at homes of Pretoria antiapartheid activists
 during a peaceful church-sponsored desegregation campaign.
 There were no reports of incidents of "necklacing" in 1989.
 (The victim is executed by a burning tire placed around the
 neck.) In January members of Mrs. Winnie Mandela's informal
 bodyguard were implicated in the abduction of four youths.
 One of the four, 14-year old Stompie Moeketsi, was killed, and
 
 
 336
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Mrs. Mandela personally came under criticism over the
 incident. Police investigations were continuing at year's end.
 Two restricted Natal detainees, Chris Ntuli and Eric Gumede,
 were assassinated in April and August 1989, shortly after
 their release from detention. Like a majority of detained
 antigovernment activists, they were released with harsh
 restriction orders which forced them to keep predictable
 routines and physically remain in stipulated areas, making
 them easy targets for assault and assassination.
 Vigilantes, especially in Natal, seem to operate with impunity
 or tacit official sanction. According to well-placed human
 rights sources, very few crimes of suspected vigilante origin
 have been solved by the police. In September Warmbaths
 activist David Kutu was takeft by three men to a nearby dam and
 beaten. Kutu recognized one of his assailants as a black
 sergeant in the local police force. The assailants identified
 themselves as belonging to the White Wolves. In October a
 former black police officer on death row alleged that he had
 been part of an SAP hit squad which assassinated a prominent
 Durban activist in 1984. Another former policman claimed to
 be a part of a squad which stabbed to death Griffiths Mxenge,
 a civil rights lawyer, in Durban in 1981. These allegations,
 further corroborated by the voluntary statements of at least
 two other former policemen--including a white former security
 police captain--seemed to confirm long-held (but never proven)
 suspicions within antiapartheid circles of death squads
 operating within the Government. Despite the arrests of at
 least two suspected death squad members, President De Klerk
 decided not to call for an independent judicial investigation
 into the matter, leaving the investigation in the hands of the
 South African police and prosecutors.
 The existence of the White Wolves first came to public view
 during the trial of Barend Strydom, sentenced to death in May
 for gunning down eight black persons in a central Pretoria
 square. Human rights observers express concern that the White
 Wolves might in fact be composed of rogue elements within the
 security forces. Also of concern were disclosures of
 secretive paramilitary components of rightwing extremists
 organizations such as the Afrikaner Resistance Movement
 (AWB). Several members of these hate groups were apprehended
 by South West African police in connection with a fatal attack
 on a United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) office
 in Namibia.
 There was also political violence in the homelands. On July
 1, nine Bophuthatswana policemen and two civilians died in the
 rural village of Leeuwfontein in violence protesting
 incorporation into the "independent" homeland. Bophuthatswana
 police, including seconded South African Government security
 officials, responded with arrests and repression that left the
 village a virtual ghost town.
 Conflict between the ANC and South African security forces
 abated in 1989 in comparison to the numerous bombings and
 casualties that occurred in 1988. There were few reports of
 clashes between government forces and ANC forces, either due
 to attempted guerrilla infiltration or to cross-border raids
 by the SADF. Although the ANC has not renounced the armed
 struggle, it appeared to shift its emphasis from armed
 confrontation to development of a new diplomatic offensive.
 However, the ANC external organization appears to have limited
 control over its operatives once they enter South Africa.
 
 
 37
 SOUTH ARICA
 There were no reports of of any ANC-caused fatalities in
 1989. While the ANC in 1989 appeared to be downplaying
 violent confrontation with Pretoria, PAC spokesmen called for
 the continuation of the armed struggle. The PAC and other
 organizations have also been involved in attacks in South
 Africa. In 1989 the Government sentenced PAC member Vusumuzi
 Mandoyi to 10 years, imprisonment for a hand grenade attack on
 police in 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of antiapartheid leaders
 disappearing while in police custody in 1989. However, in
 recent years many activists have disappeared into police
 custody for long periods. Some are suspected by friends and
 associates to have been killed by security forces. South
 African law-and SOE regulations do not require notification of
 a person's family, lawyer, or any other person in the event of
 detention, and prohibit the unauthorized publication of the
 name of any person detained for "the prevention of, or
 combating of, terroristic activities." The June 1988
 disappearance case of Maisha "Stanza" Bopape, a Community
 Research and-Information Center (CRIC) staff member and
 township activist, remains-unsolved. Police claim that Bopape
 escaped from custody, but his associates fear that he may have
 been killed. Also unsolved are the cases of Port Elizabeth -
 Black Civic Organization leaders Sipho Hashe, Champion Galela,
 and Qaqawuli Godolozi, who disappeared in May 1985.
 Following the June 1986-emergency declaration, and in the wake
 of subsequent crackdowns on various opposition organizations,
 many black activists left the country surreptitiously or went
 into hiding to avoid detention. These circumstances further
 complicated the task of accounting accurately for the many
 persons who repoitedly have disappeared. Government press
 curbs imposed in December 1986 prohibited news reporting on
 detention cases and on unresolved litigation concerning
 detentions without prior government clearance, which rendered
 the task of accounting for missing persons still more
 problematic.
 Since August 1986, the Minister of Law and Order periodically
 has tabled lists of SOE detainees in Parliament. These lists
 included only detainees held for at least 30 days and appeared
 to be incomplete. -Human rights monitoring groups estimated
 that substantial numbers of detainees have not been named in
 the Government's lists and maintained that in most cases
 family members were not informed of emergency detentions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Security legislation, in particular the ISA, allows police
 generally unsupervised discretion to arrest and detain
 suspects and to interrogate detainees. People detained under
 the ISA may receive visits from their attorneys and families
 only at the discretion of the Commissioner of Police. This
 permission-is often denied. The ISA allows for lengthy
 periods of incommunicado detention during which authorities
 are not obliged to present formal charges, a situation which
 provides considerable potential for police abuse of detainees.
 Laws exempting law enforcement officials from both criminal
 and civil liability for so-called good faith acts undertaken
 in enforcing the SOE have been cited by many observers as
 giving police a license to engage in abusive conduct.
 
 
 338
 SOUTH AFRICA
 During 1989, as in 1988, court testimony and sworn affidavits
 increasingly documented the claims of lawyers and human rights
 activists that severe beatings and torture are still used
 against security detainees. Though the number of incidents
 overall seem to be declining, torture of detainees in the
 so-called homelands continued. There were numerous
 allegations of police assaults and torture during widespread
 discontent in Venda on the anniversary of "independence." In
 Bophuthatswana, there were mass detentions fo3loi4ing clashes
 between police and residents of Braaklagte and Leeuwfontein
 who were resisting forced incorporation into Bophuthatswana.
 The police used excessive force, including beatings, in
 containing the situation and confined detainees in
 overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The presence of South
 African security officials "seconded" to these homelands and
 seemingly connected to these incidents of torture belies
 government claims of noninvolvement in homeland affairs and
 these homelands' claims of independence.
 Commonly used methods of torture include prolonged solitary
 confinement and suffocation by placing bags over detainees'
 heads. Sick or wounded detainees and hunger strikers are
 sometimes handcuffed to their beds, regardless of their
 condition and even, on occasion, the presence of armed guards
 at their bedside. Denial of medical attention has been
 reported. In one case, a detainee alleged police tortured him
 by pulling on his thigh, previously shattered by gunshots, for
 6 hours before providing medical treatment.
 Police brutality increasingly came to light, especially in
 connection with repression of peaceful antiapartheid
 demonstrations in the latter half of 1989. Police Lt. Gregory
 Rockman became a cause celebre by severely criticizing riot
 police behavior against demonstrators in Mitchells Plain, Cape
 Region, during preelection unrest. The magistrate hearing a
 case arising from Lt. Rockman's claims found the riot squad
 actions "utterly despicable" but acquitted two riot police
 officers under the immunity accorded to police under the SOE.
 In connection with Rockman's complaint, a magistrate cleared
 two riot police officers of police brutality when dispersing a
 crowd at Mitchells Plain, despite finding police conduct
 "reprehensible." Police also came under critical public
 scrutiny in September for their use of stun guns in prisons.
 To counter the negative image police and security force
 members have among many South Africans, the Government has
 initiated in-house investigations of alleged abuses and
 misconduct, but these have failed to stem public criticism.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The ISA authorizes detention without trial for varying--in
 many instances unlimited--periods of time. Under Section 29
 of the ISA, the Minister of Law and Order may issue preventive
 detention orders allowing for detention of up to 180 days in
 "unrest situations." Access to ISA detainees is severely
 restricted. Under Section 29, senior police officials have
 broad powers to detain people for interrogation when offenses
 such as terrorism, sabotage, or inciting a revolution are
 suspected. Many people in detention under Section 29 were
 held for long periods of time without any questioning taking
 place.
 Under the SOE, SADF members and police officers down to the
 rank of constable are empowered to.detain persons for up to 30
 days. Police station cells may be used as the place of
 
 
 339
 SOUTH AFRICA
 detention for the first 14 days after which detainees must be
 transferred to cells in prisons unless the Commissioner of
 Police grants.an.exception. After 30 days the Minister of Law
 and Order may extend the detention indefinitely, limited only
 by the duration of the SOE. Emergency detainees may be denied
 access to lawyers and have no right to a hearing before the
 Minister extends the detention.
 The Government has effectively used SOE laws to hold political
 activists in long-term detention without trial, e.g., Obed
 Madonsela, detained for over 10 months in 1988-89. However,
 the number of detainees held during 1989, especially under the
 SOE, declined dramatically. Hunger strikes beginning in
 January appear to have been a factor in the SAG's decision to
 release -large numbers of SOE detainees. As of late December
 there were 18 being detained under SOE regulations, 24
 detained under the ISA (press reports in September indicated
 another 470 may be detained in Venda under its own ISA), and
 about 2,000-3,000 were serving criminal sentences from
 convictions stemming from incidents of political unrest.
 There were no childrenunder 18 reported as detained at the
 end of 1989. The Government's refusal to provide specific
 statistics or complete lists of those being held made it
 difficult to confirm the actual number of detainees.
 Statistics on detentions failed to account fully for what
 appeared to be a common police tactic of detaining political
 activists, especially youths, and holding them for a few hours
 or overnight, during which time they were interrogated,
 threatened, and sometimes beaten. .In addition, many people
 have been arrested on criminal charges during incidents of
 political unrest.
 The Government imposed restrictions on approximately 65
 percent of the detainees released. While the Government
 appears to have abandoned the practice of formally banning
 persons under the ISA, effective banning has returned under
 the guise of SOE "restrictions." Regulations published in
 1988 allow the Government to restrict .people simply by
 publishing their names, with no need to serve the orders on
 the restricted person. SOE regulations promulgated in June
 prohibit quoting any individual "commonly known" as a
 spokesperson for a restricted organization, even if that
 person is not restricted. Restrictions vary greatly but
 generally prevent ex-detainees from engaging in antigovernment
 activity. In one extreme example, Baba Dlamini was restricted
 to his home for 20 hours a day and had to report to a police
 station twice during the other 4 hours. An estimated 90D
 former detainees have been restricted upon their release.
 Prominent restricted antiapartheid activists include UDF
 Co-President Archie Gumede, UDF Treasurer Azar Cachalia,
 Azanian People's Organization (AZAPO) national organizer
 Charles Mabitsela, and UDF activist and lawyer Yunus Mahomed.
 The Government at the end of 1989 lifted the restriction
 orders for former political prisoner and ANC leader Govan
 Mbeki. Restrictees describe life under restrictions as having
 been released from prison into a larger form of jail, and for
 some there is the increased, potential danger from assault and
 assassination by vigilantes (see Section l.a.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The South African judiciary is headed by the Appellate
 Division of the Supreme Court in Bloemfontein and six regional
 Supreme Courts. All judges of South Africa's higher courts
 are white, as are the vast majority of its magistrates. They
 
 
 340
 SOUTH AFRICA
 are appointed to the bench by the State President. Their
 service is until age 70, and they cannot be removed from
 office except by impeachment by Parliament. By tradition,
 judges of the Appellate Division and the Supreme Courts are
 appointed to the bench from the ranks of the elite corps of
 South African Supreme Court practitioners ("Advocates-).
 South Africa has an adversarial system of criminal justice
 drawn from a mixed heritage of Roman-Dutch and English
 jurisprudence. Trials of lesser offenses are heard by
 magistrates, who are career employees of the civil service in
 the executive branch. More serious offenses, including
 capital crimes, are tried in the Supreme Courts.
 Determinations of guilt or innocence are made by the presiding
 judge or magistrate. Juries were abolished in 1969. Judges
 in capital and other serious cases are empowered to appoint
 two assessors who serve as fact finders and who have the power
 to overrule the presiding judge on questions of fact but not
 on questions of law.
 Defendants in criminal cases, including political cases, may
 retain legal counsel, but recent studies showed that 50
 percent of those convicted in ordinary criminal cases had no
 representation. The Natal Supreme Court in July held that
 legal representation was not vital to the fairness of a trial
 and that accused persons did not have the right to
 representation if they could not afford it. In 1989 Lawyers
 for Human Rights continued a major pro bono project begun in
 1988 which aims to have 2,000 participating lawyers donating 5
 days a year each, the first large-scale effort of its kind to
 be undertaken in South Africa. As a matter of practice,
 courts usually appoint counsel in capital cases where the
 defendant cannot afford a lawyer.
 Persons charged with common crimes are presumed innocent until
 proven guilty, although Parliament has modified the general
 presumption of innocence for many security offenses. The ISA
 effectively places the burden of proof of innocence on the
 accused for a number of offenses enumerated in the Act. Both
 security-related and common crimes cases are tried in civilian
 courts, although security trials are sometimes held in remote
 locations. Because of case backlogs, postponements, and the
 practice of hearing cases concurrently, criminal trials, and
 particularly security cases, can sometimes take months, even
 years, to complete.
 A new Chief Justice of the Appeals Court was appointed in
 1988, and fears about the Court's politicization have eased
 somewhat. However, the power of the South African judiciary
 at all levels is circumscribed by stringent security
 legislation and by the principle of parliamentary sovereignty,
 under which judges possess no authority to alter, strike down,
 or refuse to enforce properly drafted and enacted laws of
 Parliament. Nevertheless, the courts have been the focal
 point for much litigation against human rights abuses. In
 some instances, the Government has admitted abuses and reached
 out-of-court settlements.
 Since its declaration in June 1986, there have been a number
 of legal challenges to the SOE and detention without trial.
 In the initial months, courts ordered a small number of
 detainees freed and declared some SOE regulations unlawful.
 But in most cases the Government rewrote and reissued the
 regulations to prevent further court challenges. Moreover,
 the courts have consistently stated that the SOE itself was
 
 
 341
 SOUTH.AFRICA
 lawfullYzeclared.   An Appeals Court decision in 1988 held
 that an emergency regulation could not be invalidated for
 being "unreasonable" or "vague", a ruling which could severely
 limit further legal challenges to-the SOE.
 Long political trials, serve to keep prominent activists out of
 circulation for extended periods of time. Many defendants are
 eventually acquitted. Partial HRC statistics indicated that
 there were some 99 trials under the ISA and other statutes in
 1988 involving 317 people of whom 165 were acquitted. There
 were 258 persons facing charges of treason in 8 trials during
 1988. Only 2 of those were concluded by the end of 1988, with
 4 of 27 defendants convicted for treason--all from the Delmas
 treason trial. From October 1988 to August 1989, 861 people
 were charged in 248 political trials, with 350 convicted, 172
 acquitted, and 341 with charges withdrawn.
 In June, 14 defendants of the "Upington 25" court case were
 sentenced to death for the murder of a policeman in 1985.
 Although only one person was found to have actually struck the
 victim, the others were convicted using the "common purpose"
 doctrine where a person may be guilty of a crime for sharing a
 common purpose with those who commit the actual crime.
 According to the South African, Journal of Human Rights
 (SAJHR), this is one of the largest numbers of simultaneously
 passed death sentences in South African legal history.
 In November 1988. 11 of 22 defendants (including 3 prominent
 UDF officials) were found guilty in the Delmas Treason
 Trial--considered the most important political trial in recent
 times. All the defendants, members of the UDF, AZAPO, and
 various black civic associations, were convicted for their
 antiapartheid activity during the 1984-86 upheavals. The
 court accepted the Statels claims that the UDF and other
 antiapartheid organizations had followed the dictates of the
 ANC and promoted the violent overthrow of the Government. In
 an unprecedented move, the presiding judge dismissed one
 assessor in March l987 for having signed a UDF petition. In
 September the Appeals Court decided, in the interest of saving
 time and expense, to hear an appeal on the procedural issue of
 the assessor's dismissal, and if necessary, later hear an
 appeal on substantive grounds. In December the Appeals Court
 declared a mistrial and ordered the defendants released. As
 of the end of the year, all the original defendants remained
 free and unrestricted.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The system of apartheid involves the Government in extensive
 regulation of social, personal, and family life. A person's
 identification as a member of an ethnic group or race is based
 on definitions and decisions of the Government under the
 Population -egistration Act. Under this law, every child born
 in South Africa must be registered and classified according to
 race. In'cases of dispute, such as when the parents' racial
 classification is not known, a racial classification board is
 empowered to weigh pseudoscientific evidence and to issue a
 verdict on a person's race.
 Under apartheid, association in many social settings is not a
 matter of free choice. The Separate Amenities Act allows
 public premises to be reserved for the exclusive use of
 persons of a particular race, and a substantial degree of
 social segregation, petty apartheid, still legally exists in
 
 
 342
 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa. In recent years, however, the Government has
 expanded the scope of administrative exceptions to apartheid
 laws and has allowed local option decisions on some social
 apartheid issues such as segregation of business districts and
 beaches. In 1989 some local authorities, notably in the urban
 centers of Johannesburg, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and East
 London agreed to scrap segregated public transportation,
 libraries, and swimming pools. Other areas refused to
 desegregate. Pretoria's tr-ansportation system remained
 segregated, for example, while the Durban City Council refused
 to integrate the city's remaining "whites only" beaches until
 President De Klerk issued an executive decree in December
 desegregating beaches throughout the country. Some of the
 localities controlled by Conservative Party groups, such as
 Boksburg and Carletonville, continued to enforce apartheid
 regulations which they had redmposed after the October 1988
 municipal elections. Carletonville business groups brought a
 successful court action against the city council forcing them
 to reopen municipal facilities. "Whites Only" signs were
 removed in Boksburg, but blacks attempting to use recreational
 facilities remained subject to intimidation by rightwing
 groups. The black consumer boycott in Carletonville came to
 an end after the court decision, and the Boksburg toycott was
 called off when De Klerk announced he planned to scrap the
 Separate Amenities Act.
 The Group Areas Act (GAA) of 1950 reserves all land in South
 Africa for whites, except for those areas designated for
 -blacks, Asians, and "coloreds," and requires residential areas
 to be segregated by race. Blacks are disqualified from owning
 and occupying land in urban areas not designated for them and
 from owning land in rural areas outside the 10 homelands, with
 the minor exception of "black spots"--land owned by blacks or
 religious missions prior to the enactment of the Land Acts.
 Interracial couples must reside in the area designated for the
 less advantaged racial group, vitiating the benefits of the
 repeal of the miscegenation laws in 1985. Notwithstanding the
 GAA, a number of so-called gray areas exist in some major
 cities, where blacks, "coloreds," and Asians reside in
 technically white areas, often without government
 -interference. Some private schools in white-designated areas
 admit black, "colored," and Asian students.
 In late 1988 the Government tabled a new group areas statute,
 the Free Settlement Areas Act, described as "reform" but seen
 by manytas a major step backward. While providing that
 certain residential areas might eventually be opened to all
 races, the legislation further restricts rural and periurban
 squatting, heavily penalizes illegal squatters and their
 landlords, and allows for compulsory summary eviction of
 squatters-and effective confiscation of their land. Asian and
 "colored" houses of Parliament called for the outright
 abolition of the GAA. In 1989 the Minister of Constitutional
 Affairs suggested the creation of a complicated "nongroup"
 class�fication, whereby persons presumably would be allowed to
 opt out of their current classifications and become part of
 the "nongroup." The Government was roundly criticized by
 apartheid opponents for a policy of encouraging people to
 report to the authorities any neighbors residing in an area
 not assigned to their racial group.
 For black Africans, the right to reside permanently in a
 segregated black urban township is.not available if one is
 deemed a citizen of one of the so-called independent
 
 
 343
 SOUTH'AFRICA
 homelands. Such persons are regarded as aliens in white South
 Africa, ahd, notwithstanding their birth in South Africa, are
 technically subject to restrictions similar to those for any
 foreigner. Thdy~must obtain work'permits in order to reside
 in urban areas of "WAite" South Africa,- and if they succeed in
 obtaining a w6rk permit, they may not be accompanied by their
 spouses and'children. sHundreds of thousands of such persons
 are forced to reside away from their families in urban areas,
 often in overcrowded singlersex dormitories.
 The Government owns virtually all urban black township
 property and subsidizes a program of rental housing. Local
 authorities-in the black townships administer the program and
 collect rents. In 1986 Parliaient -granted blacks the
 opportinity to acquire permanent land tenure in the
 townships' By 1989, however, only an estimated 817 freehold
 houses had b7en sold to blacks on a permanent tenure basis--up
 from 42 sold in 1988. 'Of-nearly 500,000 housing units
 available for sale, only approximately 2,500 currently are
 able to be sold because of bureaucratic problems.
 Many urban townships without electricity and running water are
 becoming more crowded as ruralpoverty drives people to seek
 jobs in urban centers. In South Africa (excluding the
 "independent" homelands) an estimated 18 to 20 million people,
 most of them black, do not have electricity. The Government
 reports that only 9 of'the 259 African townships are fully
 electrified. The restricted amount of land--available in the
 townships hs -driven up prices-for-housing lots and led to
 corruption among township officials controlling their
 allocation. Some townships are little more then permanent
 shanty towns with housing constructed of fiberboard and-
 corrugated-iron. The shortage of housing for blacks--which
 some estimates place as high -as 1.8 million units--also has
 led to the development of large squatter communities.  I
 Townships are often extraordinarily loh  commuting-distanbes
 from cities, where mdst employment -opportunities are found. A
 1985 Presideit-ks Council's report found that 70 percent of
 black commuters spent more than 3 hours daily traveling
 between home and work.
 The Black Sash, the most prominent women's antiapartheid
 organization, estimates that 5 million South African blacks
 .are without adequate shelter. An 8-year Carnegie-sponsored
 study,. based on interviews with 400 South:Africans, documented
 "appalling" depths of South Africa's poverty. Half of all
 households have incomes below the minimum living level.
 Infant mortality among blacks is eight times that of whites.
 The Land Acts of 1913 and 1936 limit land ownership in rural
 areas to whites. Blacks are allowed'to live in nonhomeland
 rural areas only with the permission of white landowners.
 nearly all are farm laborers whose numbers and freedom of
 movement are regulated by a number of other statutes. The GAA
 and these statutes are. the bases for the Government's practice
 of "forcef removals." For 3 decades, the Government has
 forcibly relocated black.South Africans from land reserved for
 whites, often to areas in the homelands with hopelessly
 inadequate infrastructure and~insufficient land and water for
 profitable (or even subsistence) 'agriculture. The South
 African Council of Churches (SACC) has estimated that since
 1961, the Government has forcibly resettled approximately 3.5
 million blacks, "coloreds," and Asians. GoMernment figures
 issued in 1984 asserted that 2 million blacks had been
 resettled since 1960.
 
 
 344
 SOUTH AFRICA
 In early 1985, the Government announced a suspension of forced
 removals in favor of-a policy of negotiating with affected
 communities on relocation issues. However, in July 1987, the
 State President qualified this "no forced removals" pledge,
 stating that there would be no forced removal "unless it is
 accompanied with the provision of better living conditions."
 In some situations, the Government has engaged in effectively
 coercive removals'by refusing to maintain the limited
 infrastructures of black communities and by engaging in
 physical threats and aggressive actions aimed at convincing
 reluctant people to move.
 In August a court ruling set aside a 1988 government decree
 declaring the 60-year-old black community of Oukasie an
 "emergency camp." The declaration had been seen as the
 prelude to forced removal of the 6,000-person community to
 Letlhabile township near Bophuthatswana. The community
 opposed removal on the suspicion that Letlhabile would
 eventually be incorporated into Bophuthatswana, stripping its
 members of their South African citizenship. Vigilantes
 continue to attack activists opposed to the removal in an
 effort to coerce them to abandon their village. In December
 residents of East Peelton were driven from their homes by
 Ciskeian authorities because of their continued opposition to
 their community's August 1988 incorporation into Ciskei
 without their having been consulted. In the first concession
 of its kind in incorporation cases, the residents were granted
 the use of land for resettlement (at least temporarily)
 "inside" South Africa after unsuccessful mediation between
 South African and Ciskeian authorities.
 Studies completed during 1987 indicated that the Government's
 policy of settling blacks on arid land far from population
 centers has serious consequences in regard to nutrition. In a
 malnutrition survey, Operation Hunger reported severe
 impoverishment among South African rurql blacks, particularly
 in the so-called independent homelands. Malnutrition is also
 a serious problem in congested and depressed periurban
 resettlement areas such as Botshabelo, near Bloemfontein.
 Various laws give police the authority in specific
 circumstances to enter homes without a warrant, including
 situations where an officer has reason to believe a warrant
 would be issued but that the delay caused by first obtaining
 the warrant would defeat the purpose of the search. In
 practice, police often enter and search homes of black
 activists as a means of intimidation, often in the early
 morning hours.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While South Africans speak freely on most issues, the SOE and
 security legislation limit discussion of certain political
 themes. Segments of South Africa's almost totally white-owned
 press continued to engage in vigorous criticism of the
 Government and its policies. However, SOE regulations
 severely impair freedom of expression and of the press by
 making reporting of "subversive statements" (e.g., encouraging
 strikes, boycotts, or the promotion of disinvestment) a
 criminal offense. The regulations also ban television
 coverage, still photography, sketching, and radio recording
 from areas covered by the SOE. Media may not report on police
 or security force operations in "unrest situations," except as
 
 
 345
 SOUTH AFRICA
 information--always limited--is re-leased by the Government.
 Penalti'es for infractions include-iines of up to $8,000 and
 imprisonment for up to 10 years. It is a criminal offense to
 publish material on political unrest,.-detention cases,
 treatment of detainees, and various-types of political
 activity -without- prior government clearance.
 In 1989 the'press in South Africa remained under pressure.
 Regulations published in 1987 streamlined the method by which
 publications can be censored and gave the Minister of Home
 Affairs the power to close a publication for up to 3 months
 without explanation. In February 1989, the Minister exercised
 this power, closing the periodicals Grass Roots and New Era
 for 3 months.
 Throughout 1989 a variety of regulations were used to charge
 editors and publications. In May th= former editor of the
 magazine SouthAt- charged with contravening the SOE by
 publishing'an article on"'a school boycott. In June the editor
 of the newspaper Vrye Weekblad was found guilty of charges
 brought against him under the ISA and given a 6-month
 suspended sentence; the-Same editor late in the year faced six
 charges under the SOE for publishing an article allegedly
 undermining the system of military conscription. The editor
 of Saamstaan was charged in July-under the Prisons Act for
 publishing a photograph of Nelson Mandela (and with seven
 other charges related to-contravening the SOE and the ISA).
 Also in July, the editor and two former journalists of the
 Weekly Mail were summoned under the SOE for articles on the
 conditions and treatment of political detainees. In August
 the editors of the.Sunday Times, New Nation, Sowetan, and
 Weekly Mail were charged under the ISA for quoting a listed
 person; Times Media (the publishers of the Sunday Times)
 received a $800 fine. The Natal Mercury, Star, Daily News,
 and Sunday Tribune were informed by the police in September
 that they were being investigated. In October the editor of
 the South African Press Association (SAPA) was subpoenaed
 under the Criminal Procedure Act to answer questions and
 produce documents in connection with an investigation of
 changes that he had distributed a trade union press release.
 The S0E media regulations are sufficiently vague to create an
 atmosphere of uncertainty among editors, resulting in a
 situation where self-censorship is common, and opposition
 newspaper-editors often surrender ultimate editing
 responsibility to their lawyers. Opposition publications pay
 expensive legal fees for advice prior to publishing stories,
 testing the limits of the regulations and for the defense of
 their actions in court. By late August, journalists and
 editors began consistently testing the media regulations in
 their coverages of the defiance campaign. The Government,
 adopting a new tactic, began obstructing journalists at the
 scene of unrest by immediately ordering them out of the area,
 detaining them, or arresting them. Over 100 journalists had
 been detained by the middle of September, including the
 American Broadcasting Corporation bureau chief, who was
 charged under the SOE with "attending an illegal gathering."
 Since De Klerk's administration has been in power, media
 regulations have gone largely unenforced. There is
 speculation that many media restrictions will be lifted in
 1990.
 Under the Publications Act (applicable to most periodicals,
 with the exception of newspapers), the importation,
 possession, and publication of politically or morally
 
 
 346
 SOUTH AFRICA
 "undesirable" works is prohibited. Materials subject to
 censorship include those found to be "indecent or obscene,"
 "blasphemous," or "prejudicial to the safety of the state."
 Decisions of the Publications Appeal Board are not subject to
 judicial review, except in rare instances, and can be
 quixotic. The antiapartheid movie, "Dry White Season," was
 shown at a film festival with only minor cuts; in 1988 the
 antiapartheid movie, "Cry Freedom," was banned after one
 showing.
 The Government exercises a near monopoly on television and
 radio broadcasting through the state-owned South African
 Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). With some exceptions, SABC
 reflects progovernment viewpoints in both its news reporting
 and editorial policy. While the Government professes that
 SABC is politically independent, a wide range of the political
 spectrum, including the liberal Democratic Party and the
 rightwing Conservative Party, characterizes the SABC as an
 editorial arm of the ruling National Party. The appointment
 of Christo Viljoen as the new Director General of SASC may
 have inaugurated a more evenhanded approach; in the weeks
 leading up to the September 6 election, SABC offered a
 wide-ranging political debate on election issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The ISA seriously obstructs freedom of assembly, giving
 magistrates the power to ban or impose conditions on the
 holding of public meetings and to close off areas to the
 public to prevent prohibited gatherings. Police can also ban
 meetings under the SOE regulations. A ban on all outdoor
 gatherings except sports events or specially authorized
 meetings, in effect since 1976, was renewed again in 1989.
 Restrictions on funerals of political activists or victims of
 political violence also remain on the books. Throughout 1989
 police frequently arrested persons in the townships on charges
 of participating in illegal gatherings and used the powers
 conferred on them by the SOE to repress peaceful
 demonstrations and gatherings.
 On September 20 over 30,000 people marched against apartheid
 in Cape Town in one of the largest peaceful demonstrations in
 South African history. In what many observers viewed as a
 watershed event, the Government, headed by recently elected
 F.W. De Klerk, allowed the march even though official approval
 was never requested or given. The antiapartheid movement,
 represented by the MDM, proved its commitment to peaceful
 protest. The Cape Town march led to a series of large
 antiapartheid demonstrations in urban centers throighout South
 Africa--40,000 in East London on October 4 and 20,000 in
 Durban on September 29. On October 16 the media reported that
 approximately 150,000 persons demonstrated peacefully against
 apartheid and a regressive labor law in 17 places across South
 Africa with minimum police interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 South Africa has a wide variety of religious denominations,
 and the Government generally respects freedom of worship.
 Religious organizations are allowed to hold meetings and other
 activities without interference as long as they do not
 seriously challenge government policies. As with other
 aspects of South African life, churches are often organized
 along racial lines, but many churcbes (including a growing
 number of white churches) challenge apartheid on moral
 
 
 347
 SOUTH AFRICA
 grounds. In 1989 the white branch of the Dutch Reformed
 Church in S6uth-Africa went as far as calling apartheid a
 "sin."
 The Defense Act provides alternative service options for
 pacifist religious objectors to national military service.
 (Only white males are obliged to do military service.)
 Members.of mainstream churches are granted alternative service
 only in rare instances., Conscientious objectors on
 nonreligious grounds continue to be subject to a 6-year prison
 sentencev Charles Besterwas sentenced to 6 years in 1988 for
 refusing alternative service, apparently without being given
 the normal one-third remission of sentence. Dr. Ivan Toms was
 released on bail in 1989, pending an appeal-for the same
 offense. Douglas Torr, an Anglican deacon, refused to report
 for military service in August and was scheduled for an
 initial hearing-in January 1990. An estimated 15 percent of
 those called up for their 2-year military service fail to
 -report, with the incidence of no-shows reportedly increasing.
 In 1989 reports indicated that the military intended to halve
 the-required military service time from 2 years to 1. In
 September, 780 youths publicly-stated their intentions not to
 do their military service.
 Because of the restrictions on virtually all black opposition,
 church leaders have found themselves in the forefront of the
 antiapartheid movement. This resulted in growing tension
 between the Government and churchmen such as Anglican
 Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu; Rev. Allan Boesak,
 President of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches; and Rev.
 Frank Chikane,-Secretary General of the SACC. Nevertheless,
 in 1989 church leaders continued to lead demonstrations and
 launched an interdenominational "standing for the truth"
 campaign.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 -Since the repeal of the pass laws in 1986, black South African
 citizens have no longer been required to carry
 government-issued passes in urban areas. While repeal
 represented a significant reform, some government critics
 charge that a de facto system of influx control has been
 maintained through urban housing shortages, antisquatting
 laws, and sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens
 from the four independent homelands. Regulations requiring
 citizens of so-called independent homelands to obtain work
 permits for employment in the rest of South Africa could
 provide a basis for future deportations of large numbers of
 people to the "independent" homelands.
 Assignments of blacks to homelands take place regardless of
 their wishes or the fact that they may not have been born in,
 lived in, or even visited, their putative homelands. When a
 homeland is granted so-called independence by the Government,
 blacks assigned to that homeland lose their South African
 citizenship and ostensibly receive the citizenship of the
 homeland. An estimated 8 million blacks have lost South
 African citizenship under this policy by legislation granting
 independence to: Transkei (1976); Bophuthatswana (1977);
 Venda (1979) and Ciskei (1981). A 1986 law provided for
 restoration of South African citizenship to a limited class of
 blacks who were denationalized as a result of homeland
 independence grants--those with permanent residence rights in
 South Africa. The Government believes that this reform will
 
 
 348
 OUTHAFRICA
 apply only to about 1.75 million of the estimated 4 million
 citizens of "independent" homelands residing outside those
 homelands.
 South Africans must possess valid travel documents to travel
 abroad or emigrate legally. These documents generally are not
 difficult for whites to obtain, although some white
 antiapartheid activists have been denied passports. Blacks
 assigned to an "independent" homeland usually cannot obtain
 South African passports because they are not considered by the
 Government to be citizens of South Africa. The refusal of
 some blacks to travel on a homeland passport has the effect of
 deterring them from traveling abroad. In 1982 the Rand
 Supreme Court ruled that the Minister of Home Affairs has the
 absolute discretion to revoke or refuse to issue a passport.
 The Government regularly refuses passports to persons whom it
 regards as critical of the status quo. The Ministry of Home
 Affairs stated that in 1988, 169 people were refused
 passports--112 blacks, 20 "coloreds", 24 Asians, and 23 whites.
 Although South Africa is not a party to international
 conventions on refugees, monitoring groups estimate that more
 than 250,000 Mozambicans displaced by civil strife have
 entered South Africa, including about 68,000 children.
 Approximately 205,000 of these refugees live in the homelands
 of Kangwane and Gazankulu or work as farm laborers in the
 Eastern Transvaal. Mozambicans apprehended outside these
 areas without permission are forcibly repatriated without an
 interview to determine whether they are refugees who can
 safely be returned. South African private and voluntary
 organizations as well as the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) provide relief assistance in the homelands.
 The Government permits access by international observers to
 refugee areas.
 The Government has taken harsh measures to prevent the entry
 of more Mozambicans by erecting an electrified fence along the
 South African border with Mozambique. On several occasions
 during 1989, the Government turned off the fence to allow
 refugees to cross safely into South Africa during clashes
 along the border between guerrillas and Mozambican forces.
 However, the refugees were promptly repatriated once the
 immediate danger was considered to have passed.
 The number of South Africans who are officially registered as
 refugees in neighboring countries and benefit from assistance
 from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has not
 grown significantly since 1985 and remains approximately
 22,000. Most of these "refugees" are affiliated in some way
 with one of the antiapartheid organizations in exile.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The extent to which South African citizens have the right to
 change their government democratically depends on race. The
 majority of them, the blacks, have no such right. The 1983
 Constitution created a tricameral Parliament with separate
 chambers for whites, "coloreds," and Asians. Officially
 registered political parties may operate freely. The
 respective groups are represented in the tricameral Parliament
 on a racial ratio of 4 white /2 "colored"/l Asian, thus
 ensuring white dominance. Members of each house are elected
 from separate, racially based voter rolls. Each house has
 primary responsibility for its "own'affairs," i.e.,
 
 
 349
 SOUTH AFRICA
 legislatioi affecting its own racial constituency. The State
 President has complete discretion to decide which issues are
 of general concern and are therefore to be treated by all
 three,:chambers. Matters .that are'usually considered general
 affairs include foreign policy, defense, national security,
 and bl~Ack affairs. Education is normally dealt with as an
 "own affair" subject to general laws prescribing norms and
 standards for salaries, curriculum, and examinations.
 The terms of the 1983 Constitution and the existence of a
 white majority in Parliament ensure control by the white House
 of Assembly over general -affairs. While there is opposition
 in the House of Assembly, the majority National Party has
 controlled South African poliical power and legislative
 affairt since its first parliamentary victory in 1948. Within
 the National Party, opinions on reform of the apartheid system
 range from moderate to reactionary. Internal differences are
 in theory resolved in party caucuses, but in practice the
 State President, who is also the National Party leader,
 resolves disputes.
 In the September 1989 general election, the National Party won
 a reduced maj.ority with 93 of 166 seats (down from 124 in the
 1987 election),-and 48 percent of the popular vote. The
 Conservative Party grew in strength (though not by as much as
 had been generally expected), increasing its elected
 representation from 22 seats to 39 and winning 32 percent of
 the popular vote. The liberal opposition, the Democratic
 Party, performed more strongly than expected, winning 33 seats
 and 20 percent of the vote. State President F.W. De Klerk
 interpreted the election results as a "mandate for reform."
 Political participation for -blacks, who have no representation
 in Parliament, remains limited to the franchise in their
 respective homelands or, in the case of urban blacks, in their
 townships. While remaining committed in principle to the
 grand apartheid scheme of granting independence to more
 homelands, the Government seems to accept that no more are
 likely to accept independence. Transkei's desire to remain
 independent came into question in 1989, when its leader,
 General Holomisa, publicly spoke of allowing a popular
 referendum on the issue. Other homeland leaders, such as Enos
 Mabuza (Kangwane), Mangosuthu Buthelezi (KwaZulu), and
 Mogoboya Ramodike (Lebowa) continue to reject so-called
 independence.
 More than 10 million blacks live in townships near white urban
 areas. The only voting rights they are able to exercise are
 those granted under the Community Councils Act of 1977 and the
 Black Local Authorities Act of 1982. The latter Act elevated
 the formal status of black municipal authorities to-that
 enjoyed by white municipal governments. However, black local
 governments still face critical problems of limited powers,
 inadequate financial resources, and lack of political
 credibility. in 1989, in Soweto, well-known black
 nationalidts took over from the elected council, and South
 African provincial authorities negotiated with them an end to
 the 3-year rent boycott.
 The Government has proposed some formulas to give blacks a
 limited role in the political process, including in 1985
 multiracial Regional Services Councils and in 1986 a National
 Council to serve in an advisory capacity regarding a new
 constitutional structure for South Africa. These efforts have
 
 
 350
 SOUTH AFRICA
 been viewed by critics as devices to give the appearance but
 not the reality of power sharing.
 In 1989 the Government appeared to recognize that such limited
 steps were pointless and that new political structures for
 South Africa would have to come through negotiations. In the
 unfolding political process, ANC leader Nelson Mandela,
 assumed a new importance. Imprisoned in 1964 after his
 conviction for sabotage in the 1964 "Rivonia" trial, Mandela
 was moved from Robben Island Prison in 1988 to Pollsmoor
 Prison and subsequently to a cottage on a prison farm near
 Cape Town. In July then-State President P.W. Botha had an
 unprecedented meeting with Mandela, and in December State
 President De Klerk also met with Mandela. There was no
 information available on the substance of these meetings, but
 after each there was increased speculation that Mandela might
 be released soon.
 In the first months of the new administration, President De
 Klerk met with other black leaders, including Bishop Tutu,
 Reverend Alan Boesak, and Reverend Chickane, who presented a
 list of demands believed to be close to ANC positions. These
 included: ending the SOE; lifting all restrictions on
 political activists; and releasing all prisoners detained
 without trial. De Klerk, in signaling an interest in
 negotiations, rejected an ANC demand for an interim
 multiracial government while a new constitution was being
 worked out. At the end of 1989, contact between exiled ANC
 and various internal political pressure groups had become
 increasingly common. Unofficial meetings reportedly also
 occurred between the ANC and members of the Afrikaner
 Broederbond. De Klerk also made a number of visits to African
 countries, including Mozambique, to stress publicly his
 interest in improving relations with these countries.
 In October State President De Klerk announced the
 unconditional release of eight prominent long-term security
 prisoners. Among them were five of the original Rivonia
 defendants, including former ANC Secretary-General Walter
 Sisulu and Commander-in-Chief of the ANC military wing,
 Umkhonto We Sizwe, Raymond Mhlaba, as well as Ahmed Kathrada,
 Elias Motsoaledi, and Andrew Mlangweni. Also released were
 Oscar Mpetha, South Africa's oldest political prisoner, who
 has been described as the "father of trade unionism" in South
 Africa; Jafta Masemola, a PAC activist and South Africa's
 longest-serving political prisoner following his conviction of
 high treason in 1963; and Wilton Mkwayi, also a former
 Commander-in-Chief of Umkhonto We Sizwe.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government extends little cooperation to various United
 Nations bodies or private organizations attempting to
 investigate its human rights record. Since an October 1986
 vote by an ICRC conference in Geneva to expel a South African
 Government delegation, the Government has permitted the ICRC
 to maintain only a reduced staff in South Africa. The
 Government has been willing to allow the ICRC to visit only a
 small percentage of those jailed for political reasons,
 because of its restrictive definition of precisely who is a
 political prisoner--generally those convicted under the ISA.
 The ICRC continues to negotiate with the Government for access
 to all prisoners convicted of security-related offenses,
 
 
 351
 SOUTH AFRICA
 including those detained under the SOE. In 1989, to protest
 the Government's Lack of-response on this issue, the ICRC did
 ,not visit any-cabegory of prisoners for the fourth consecutive
 year.
 Despite continued official and extraofficial harassment, many
 -South African orgahizations continued to observe, report, and
 contest human rights violations. Lawyers for Human Rights,
 the Black Sash, the Human Rights Commission, the Legal
 Resources.Center, the South African Council of Churches, the
 University of the Witwatersrand Center for Applied Legal
 .Studies, the, Human 'Rights Trust in Port Elizabeth, and other
 groups are actikve'ly involged in a wide range of human rights
 issues and assist versons who are aggrieved by the apartheid
 and seturity laws.
 Activists involved in these and other human rights monitoring
 organizations are oftep subjected to personal harassment,
 including office break-ins, sabotage of automobiles,
 threatening phone calls, opened mail, and loss of jobs. A
 number-of human rights monitors and lawyers have been
 detained. Acts of violence against some of these groups have
 -resulted in their being asked to vacate office premises or
 venues for their activities. Some of these acts are probably
 carried 'dut by rightwing groups orutside of the'Government.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Laliguage, or Social Status
 Sonth-Africal:sblack majority and,- to a somewhat lesser
 extent7, the "colored" lnd Asian communities, suffer from
 pervasiye, legally sanctioned discrimination based on race in
 poit-i'dal; econbmic and sbbial -apects of life. For example,
 per dagita expenditure for edu&a':on is about six times
 greater for Oihjits than foi bla'cks. 'Black enrollment at white
 universities has been growing slowly. In 1989 security forces
 relaxed their strong presence around some universities, though
 they continued targeting 'studentactivists in secondary
 schools in many of the major townships for detention and
 intimidation.
 Women of 1l1 races in South Africa suffer varying degrees of
 legal, cultural, and economic-discrimination, most of which is
 based on tradition rather than codified in law. Women
 traditionally eatn lower wages than-meii. Rita Venter, who
 occupies the portfolio of'-Minister of National Health and
 -Populatioa Development, became the-first woman named to serve
 as a minister in the Government. Women generally have
 achieved more success in electoral politics at the local than
 at the national level.
 Black women suffer not only from discrimination under
 apartheid, but also from legal-disabilities based on sex.
 Parliament passed legislatiom in 1988 which brought the
 marriage laws for blacks into line with those for whites.
 Black women married subsequent to the legislation have legal
 rights- to community property accumulated during the marriage.
 maternity benefits are not guaranteed to women of any race
 under South African law, and pregnancy is a legal basis for
 dismissal from a job. A women's rights movement has taken
 hold in South Africa, and women's organizations, often
 multiracial, have been at the forefront of the struggle
 against both race and sex discrimination.
 Women activists believe that violence against women in South
 Africa is on the increase. Though the Government has enacted
 
 
 352
 SOUTH AFRICA
 legislation to help protect women, in practice police are
 unresponsive to complaints against domestic violence. Cases
 often are not pursued nor investigated properly. A major
 problem for women in South Africa has been collecting
 financial support from former spouses in cases of divorce.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 South Africa's Labor Relations Act entitles all workers in the
 private sector freely to join labor unions of their own
 choosing. Although reliable statistics are unavailable, it is
 likely that more than 2 million workers were members of trade
 unions in 1989, and probably more than 1 million of those
 members were black. Black union membership has increased
 around ten-fold since legislation a decade ago granted blacks
 full status as employees with the right to form free and
 independent trade unions. According to South Africa's
 Ministry of Manpower, total union membership in 1989
 represented approximately 24 percent of the nonagricultural
 work force.
 South Africa's unions are independent of direct government
 control. The system of apartheid, however, impinges on all
 nonwhite workers and unionists, limiting their rights of
 political protest, access to legal process, and freedom of
 expression. As unions have increasingly assumed the role of
 voicing black worker demands for political rights, the
 Government has imposed restrictions on their political
 activities. The Government in February 1988 issued an order,
 often ignored, which officially prohibits the country's
 largest trade union confederation, COSATU, from engaging in
 political activities. The Government also has banned numerous
 trade union gatherings or restricted their agendas to
 "nonpolitical" issues.
 In that connection, police have raided union offices
 throughout South Africa. In a raid on COSATU headquarters in
 August 1989 they seized a number of union documents. A South
 African court later ruled the seizure illegal and ordered the
 documents returned. Police then corrected their previous
 procedural violation and reseized the same documents. On the
 same day they raided COSATU headquarters, police raided the
 headquarters of the Food and Beverage Workers Union, an
 affiliate of NACTU, also seizing union documents.
 In addition, although reliable statistics are unavailable,
 scores of trade unionists have been detained for varying
 periods by the police during the past year under SOE and ISA
 regulations. Just prior to national elections in early
 September, seven out of nine of COSATU's regional secretaries
 were either detained or went into hiding in fear of being
 detained. Shortly thereafter, police detained an official of
 the National Union of Mineworkers, the nation's largest union,
 whom they held for 5 days.
 South Africa extended the right to strike, long enjoyed by
 white workers, to all private sector workers regardless of
 race in 1979. Since then work stoppages triggered by.
 collective bargaining disputes, and occasionally political
 issues, have been commonplace. The number of strikes in 1989
 appeared to be on the increase, but was still far less than in
 1987, a particularly turbulent year. A survey of 168 strikes
 in the first 9 months of 1989 revealed that almost 65 percent
 involved disputes over wages.
 
 
 353
 SOUTH AFRICA
 In September 1988 the Government amended South Africa's Labor
 Relations,,Act in.-a Kay regarded by workers* organizations as
 favoring employers over unions. Seen as particularly damaging
 to union strength is a section of -the Act that imposes
 responsibility-on-unions to compensate employers financially
 in the case of anillegal-strike. The Act also limits unions*
 right tQ-conduct strikes, especially sympathy and intermittent
 strikes, as well- as undermining established rights in the area
 of unfair:dismissal and making it easier for racially
 exclusive (white) minority unions to preserve access to the
 official, bargaining forums. Trade unions have focused major
 efforts against this and other sections of the Act since it
 was enacted, and COSATU has filed a complaint with the
 International LaborOrganization (ILO) claiming that the law
 abridges the right to strike and gives preference to racially
 based unions.
 South African law prohibits public employees from striking. A
 commission makes annual wage estimates for public employees,
 and legislation governing each public service sector
 establishes machinery for collective bargaining with staff
 associations and dispute resolution. I most public service
 sectors, disputes are referred to the appropriate minister and
 then to arbitration or mediation-if necessary. Public sector
 conciliation machinery is currently being reviewed to see if
 it is adequate.
 South Africa does not restrict union affiliation with regional
 or international labor organizations. The country's two
 largest confederations, COSATU and NACTU, however, have chosen
 not to seek such affiliations. Many of their affiliates as
 well as independent unions, though, have affiliated with trade
 secretariats and developed contacts with their counterparts in
 North America and Western Europe. It is not unusual, however,
 for the Government to deny passports to trade unionists for
 international travel and to deny visas to Western trade ,
 unionists for travel to South Africa. A member of the ILO
 from its inception in 1919, South Afrida withdrew from the
 organization in 1964 but remains bound by the ILO conventions
 which it has ratified.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 South African law prohibits discrimination by employers
 against union members and organizers. The Government does not
 interfere directly with union organizing in the private sector
 and has generally not intervened in the collective bargaining
 process. Excluded from the statutory system of industrial
 councils for 50 years, black unions developed a collective
 bargaining tradition of their own. Unassisted by statute,
 collective bargaining relations were established by agreement
 (called "recognition agreements") at the level of the
 enterprise on the basis of majority representation. Private
 mediation services are available and have been voluntarily
 resorted to by management and the black trade unions to
 resolve industrial disputes. The Labor Relations Act
 establishes an industrial court to rule in labor-management
 disputes, and its decisions appear to be balanced. The most
 common complaints filed with the court concern dismissals,
 followed by unfair labor practices. Many observers believe,
 however, that the amendments made to the Labor Relations Act
 last year have skewed the Act, and therefore the industrial
 court, to favor employers. A new labor appeals court now
 oversees the industrial court and can overturn its decisions.
 
 
 354
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Nevertheless, collective bargaining is freely practiced
 throughout the country with the major exceptions being public
 servants, farm workers, and domestic servants, who are not
 covered by the Labor Relations Act. In addition, South
 African labor law does not cover the so-called independent
 homelands which for the most part do not have labor  .
 legislation to match that of the Labor Relations Act. There
 are also reports that the "independent" homelands discourage
 trade union organizing. Excluding the homelands, labor laws
 and practices are applied uniformly throughout the country.
 There are no export processing zones or special labor regimes
 for export processing firms in South Africa.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 South Africa does not constitutionally or statutorily prohibit
 forced labor; however, the country's system of Roman-Dutch
 common law does not permit it, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Basic Conditions of Employment Act prohibits the
 employment of minors under age 15 in most industries, shops,
 and offices. The Mines and Works Act prohibits minors under
 16 from working underground. There is no restriction,
 however, on the age at which a person may work in agriculture.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legal minimum wage in South Africa. The Labor
 Relations Act instead provides a mechanism for negotiations
 between labor and management to set minimum wage standards
 industry by industry. At present over 100 industries covering
 most nonagricultural workers come under the provisions of the
 Act. A recent survey by the Institute for Industrial
 Relations found the average minimum wage in negotiated
 settlements with unions in 1989 to be approximately $260 per
 month. The same survey indicated that union-negotiated wage
 increases are running ahead of inflation. In comparison, a
 different survey estimated the minimum monthly household
 subsistence level for a black family of six in the
 Johannesburg area to be approximately $230. It should be
 noted that the current exchange rate understates the domestic
 purchasing power of the rand.
 Attention to health and safety issues has increased in recent
 years. The Occupational Safety Act sets forth minimum
 standards for work conditions and employment. The Act
 mandates minimum standards for workplace environment and
 machinery which are enforced by inspectors from the Ministry
 of Manpower. Although its statistics are disputed by some,
 the State-funded National Occupational and Safety Association
 claims that the number of workers suffering disabling injuries
 annually has dropped from 2.4 percent to 1.6 percent over the
 last 10 years. Most industries have a standard workweek of 46
 hours, as well as vacation and sick leave. Overtime is
 voluntary and limited to 10 hours a week. Work conditions in
 the homelands appear to be less advanced than in the rest of
 South Africa.
 
 
 355
 On June 30,.1989, in a bloodless coup d'etat, a group of
 brigadiers and colonels in the Sudanese People's Armed Forces
 (SPAF), led by Omar Hassan Ahmied "al-Bashir, overthrew Sudan's
 3-year-olddemocratic government, then headed by Prime
 Minister Sadiq al Mahdi. The new regime controls a -I the
 territory controlled by. the Sadiq Government, but much of the
 south remains in the hands of the Sudanese People's Liberation
 Army/Movement (SPLA/M), led by John Garang. The coup leaders
 arrested over 300 leading figures (most of whom were freed by
 year's end), imposed a strict curfew, suspended Sudan's 1986
 transitional constitution, abrogated press licenses, and
 dissolved all political and trade union institutions. The
 leaders then instituted a "National Salvation Revolutiouary
 Command Council" (RCC) of 15 members, drawn exclusively from
 the military. The RCC justified the coup by condemning
 Sadiq's Government for corruption and ineffectiveness,
 especially in economic areas and in its failure to end the
 civil war with the SPLA/M-
 The SPAF numbers about 75,000 men and is largely responsible
 for Sudan's internal and external security. Martial law has
 been in effect in government-controlled areas of the south for
 some time, and now extends to the north as well. A state'of
 emergency (SOE) that permits various arbitrary government
 actions has been periodically renewed outside the south since
 1985 and has been jointly enforced by the military, the
 police, and the Ministry of Interior.
 Sudan;s economy is primarily agricultural. Although the
 country is trying to diversify its cash crops, cotton and
 cottonseed still account for more than 50 percent of export
 earnings. The economy has been devastated by the expensive
 civil war (which costs perhaps $1 million per day), high
 inflation (100 percent in the first 6 months of 1989), high
 unemployment,.up to .700,000 refugees from neighboring
 countries, -nd perhaps 3 million displaced persons among the
 Sudanese.
 Many of the-serious human rights violations previously noted
 in Sudan continued in.1989 under both the Sadiq and Omar
 Governments. The RCC abolished Sudan's largely free .press,
 dissolved Sudanese labor organizations, and suspended legal
 due process by instituting arbitrary arrest, detention without
 charge, and trial of civilians by military courts. The
 continuation of Islamic law (Shari'a) throughout Sudan
 remained a major cause of southern disaffection, although the
 implementation of its more severe punishments has remained in
 abeyance since 1985.
 Government forces and government-armed militias committed many
 human rights abuses, especially in the south, as did the
 SPLA/M (although reports from SPLA/M-controlled areas are more
 fragmentary). Military operations by both sides have left
 large areas of Sudan largely unpopulated and opened
 opportunities for banditry, especially along the Ugandan
 border. Few of the 3 million displaced persons (including 1
 million near Khartoum) were resettled. Many still lack proper
 food, clothing, shelter, and medical care.
 Both before and after the coup, the SPAF, its affiliated
 militias, and the SPLA/M interfered with relief efforts and
 attacked civilians. Various cease-fires were accepted but
 then broken by one party or the other throughout the year. At
 
 
 356
 times, both sides adopted a more responsible policy toward the
 passage of relief supplies, but both sides also continued to
 block such supplies from time to time. In November the
 Government closed Sudanese air space to all relief flights,
 and the SPLA/M imposed a 72-hour advance notice requirement
 for relief flights. At year's end relief donors were
 apprehensive that the suffering of tens of thousands of
 civilians would continue and perhaps even worsen.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Government forces under both Sadiq and Omar were directly
 implicated in some instances of extrajudicial killing. In
 Meiram (Southern Kordofan) in April, soldiers beat to death a
 Dinka stopped at an army roadblock. Two of his companions
 were left bound for many hours and eventually had their arms
 amputated as a result. No charges were filed. In July a
 soldier in Omdurman shot a young boy who had apparently
 annoyed him selling cigarettes.
 The Sadiq Government appeared to condone human rights abuses
 by the military. General Burma Nassir, reportedly the
 architect in the mid-1980s of the policy of arming the
 militias (which committed widespread human rights abuses), was
 appointed to high positions under Sadiq. Major General Abu
 Gurun similarly received career-enhancing promotions, although
 his tenure as commander in the Wau area was marked by abuses
 ranging from starvation to crucifixions.
 Some actions by the Omar Government suggested a somewhat
 different attitude. General Burma Nassir was detained and Abu
 Gurun was forced to retire from government service. Soldiers
 recently accused of the revenge killings of 10-15 civilians
 and other atrocities in Wau were at least relieved, although
 not disciplined. The abolition of Sudan's formerly vigorous
 press hampered reporting of human rights abuses. Under the
 Sadiq Government, reports of extrajudicial killing appeared
 with some frequency in Sudanese newspapers.
 b. Disappearance
 Reports of disappearances were fragmentary, but numerous
 witnesses suggested that the army, security police, and
 militias in the Nuba Mountains region of Southern Kordofan
 were responsible for disappearances in 1989. One report
 alleged that Nuba tribesmen arrested for suspected SPLA/M
 affiliation were removed from holding areas and "disappeared,"
 allegedly to provide space for new detainees. Tribal militias
 were also accused of abductions for forced labor and of
 practicing slavery, especially upon displaced Dinkas.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Both government and SPLA forces were accused of ill-treatment
 of civilians, (see Section l.g.).
 In 1983 under President Nimeiri, the Sudanese Government
 adopted a version of Shari'a (Islamic) law that prescribes
 harsh corporal punishments called "Hudud," also known as the
 
 
 357
